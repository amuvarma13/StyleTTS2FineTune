28_0.wav|And you also get a free upgrade to the 16 gigs of RAM half terabyte model for that price if you pre-order.|1
28_1.wav|It's literally already marked down to that on Amazon, so I'll have a link below.|1
28_2.wav|Flagship price, yes.|1
28_3.wav|But when it's competing theoretically against some of the ultra phones, $1,000, $1,200, $1,300, then suddenly it's kind of in the category of, dare I say,|1
28_5.wav|So look, it's nearly the same on the outside.|1
28_6.wav|They've found what they like, and they're keeping it consistent, same shapes, same camera bump circle that kind of melts into the side with these neural details around it.|1
28_7.wav|It's still Gorilla Glass 5 on the back, and there's a new set of colors and textures, but in general, you'd be forgiven for thinking it's nearly the same as last year.|1
28_8.wav|Or maybe you wouldn't, but don't let that fool you.|1
28_9.wav|Up front, this screen is, I think, the biggest noticeable physical difference from last year.|1
28_10.wav|It gets way brighter, up to 1600 nits outdoors, and it's hitting crazy numbers now.|1
28_11.wav|4500 nits peak HDR brightness.|1
28_12.wav|Basically, it's super impressive and extremely readable outdoors and in any light, but it also gets|1
28_14.wav|Now I don't like that it's this curved over the edges.|1
28_15.wav|Like you can see the light fall off and the extra reflections that come with that.|1
28_16.wav|But basically from corner to corner, this 6.8 inch 1440P LTPO Pro XDR display is a real upgrade over last year.|1
28_17.wav|So then the rest of the upgrades to this phone are definitely a case of a bunch of little changes all like stacking up on top of each other to equal a large difference from last year.|1
28_19.wav|Like that's what smartphones are nowadays.|1
28_20.wav|I remember reviewing the OnePlus One and then the OnePlus Two the next year, and just the gigantic total shift, big direction changes between those two phones.|1
28_21.wav|Nowadays, it's just about like finding a bunch of clever little things and stacking a bunch of little improvements on top of each other to just make the user experience a little better.|1
28_22.wav|So obviously, if you're gonna be a flagship killer, you gotta have the newest chip inside.|1
28_23.wav|So it does, it's the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.|1
28_24.wav|Not that you'll notice a whole ton of difference side by side with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 phone,|1
28_25.wav|but this phone does have much better cooling as well.|1
28_26.wav|So it's giving them some headroom to play with slightly boosted clock speeds and it's benchmarking right behind the gaming phones and the S24 Ultra.|1
28_27.wav|In real world use, that just means this phone is super fast.|1
28_30.wav|Like this is something OnePlus has done really well for a long time, even with high performance mode being off in the battery settings by default.|1
28_31.wav|But speaking of battery, this phone is definitely prioritizing battery, super long battery life over like ultra high end performance numbers and getting every last FPS out of the thing.|1
28_32.wav|And as a result, this is a battery champ.|1
28_33.wav|First of all, you just start with a huge capacity.|1
28_34.wav|So it's got one of the biggest batteries ever in a OnePlus flagship.|1
28_35.wav|It's now a 5,400 milliamp hour battery.|1
28_36.wav|That's bigger than a lot of other phones that are ultras now.|1
28_37.wav|And you better believe they've kept their trademark super fast charging also.|1
28_38.wav|So it's technically a split battery.|1
28_0.wav|And you also get a free upgrade to the 16 gigs of RAM half terabyte model for that price if you pre-order.|1
28_1.wav|It's literally already marked down to that on Amazon, so I'll have a link below.|1

28_37.wav|And you better believe they've kept their trademark super fast charging also.|1
28_38.wav|So it's technically a split battery.|1
128_0.wav|It is noticeable at first when you just look at the bezels.|1
128_1.wav|But again, it's one of those things where you start using the phone and it is easy to forget about.|1
128_2.wav|You know, I think a lot of videos are gonna hold it up side by side next to the Samsung fold.|1
128_3.wav|And then it's like, oh yeah, clearly one of them has a dramatically thinner bezel and it is really noticeable.|1
128_5.wav|It looks fine and Google actually says that this was an intentional decision.|1
128_7.wav|but it did allow them room to put in a real webcam or selfie camera instead of a under display one.|1
128_8.wav|But also I think this is a little bit along the lines of Google.|1
128_9.wav|The Pixel has never really been all about pristine, super highly engineered, like amazing hardware.|1
128_10.wav|They've sort of flexed their strengths on the software side.|1
128_11.wav|And I think there's a little bit of that here too.|1
128_12.wav|Either way, you can check the box of IPX8 water resistance, which is nice.|1
128_13.wav|I do really like this satin finish on the back, which does a good job of minimizing fingerprints and looks pretty good.|1
128_14.wav|And the camera bump doesn't go all the way to the very edges to meet the rails of the phone.|1
128_15.wav|That would have been tough with the foldable, but I do still think they did a good job of maintaining the whole pixel aesthetic.|1
128_16.wav|Performance is...|1
128_19.wav|It's actually the best of any Pixel phone, even though it's using the same chip.|1
128_20.wav|It's the Tensor G2 from the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro, but it's, yeah, it feels smoother and faster and more consistent than the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro.|1
128_21.wav|So, you know, maybe it could be that 12 gigs of RAM that are in here.|1
128_25.wav|Now, it's still a Pixel, so I have to add the disclaimer that it might not stay this way.|1
128_26.wav|Pixels have a history of this accelerated aging, which is even more of a bummer when you pay this much for a phone, but I can't report on that until we actually get to a year from now.|1
128_27.wav|So the best I can do is tell you how it's acting now, and it is acting great.|1
128_28.wav|The other thing though, that I am kind of actually hoping changes over time,|1
128_30.wav|Because the battery life in the first, this week that I've been testing the phone has not been great.|1
128_31.wav|Usually actually I can kind of just throw away the first day or two of me testing this phone because it's, you know, still setting it up, still connecting everything and getting it working properly.|1
128_32.wav|And then I can start looking at the numbers, but basically every day since I first got this phone, I've kind of had the same experience, which is not that great.|1
128_33.wav|Four hours of screen on time at the end of my day.|1
128_34.wav|which is not nearly as high as some of the flagships out there.|1
128_35.wav|It is a 4,800 milliamp hour battery, which is really good for a foldable, but not gigantic for a giant screen on the inside.|1
128_36.wav|So pixels have this feature called adaptive battery, and sometimes they can get a little bit better|1
18_0.wav|thing they really wanted to do, but because they didn't go all Exynos right from the get-go, they split it, they had some Exynos and some Snapdragon,|1
18_1.wav|the Snapdragon phones would consistently and regularly outperform the Exynos version of the same phone across the board.|1
18_2.wav|Better performance, better efficiency, better battery, better heat.|1
18_3.wav|It literally got to the point where prospective buyers would jump into subreddits and forums to try to find where they could import a Qualcomm version of the phone instead of the Exynos one available in their own country.|1
18_4.wav|And there are a whole bunch of tutorials on if you're buying a secondhand one, how do you know which version you're getting just based on the serial number, just so you can avoid the Exynos version.|1
18_5.wav|Like I said, in hindsight, ahead of their time a bit here, but big backfire.|1
18_6.wav|Nevertheless, there was lots of other stuff that was so new about this phone, it justified another increase in price all the way up to $750.|1
18_8.wav|So Galaxy S9.|1
18_9.wav|I'm gonna say this was peak Samsung Galaxy S. I loved this Galaxy S9.|1
18_10.wav|And again, it was Galaxy S9 and S9+.|1
18_11.wav|Now this was a relatively incremental update versus S8, but you know, slightly thinner bezels, same RAM, same storage, but a slightly improved processor.|1
18_14.wav|And then they also moved that fingerprint sensor on the back from right next to the camera to right under the camera.|1
18_18.wav|So this time they tried this dual aperture thing with the camera and it was super cool.|1
18_19.wav|Basically, it could snap between F 1.5 wide open and F 2.4, a variable aperture in a smartphone.|1
18_20.wav|It's a clever little thing that would let you receive as much light as possible in low light situations.|1
18_21.wav|But when you have plenty of light, it would stop down to 2.4 and it would get more in focus.|1
18_22.wav|It would be a sharper, better looking photo.|1
18_23.wav|And I remember I loved it when I used it.|1
18_24.wav|Other reviewers loved it when they used it.|1
18_26.wav|Samsung, we miss this.|1
18_28.wav|But honestly, this is one of those phones picking it up now.|1
18_29.wav|Like, I've talked about this before.|1
18_30.wav|If you could bring back any old phone design from whatever year and just modernize it with new specs and new software, I think between HTC One|1
18_31.wav|M8 or M9, and this phone, pretty good candidates.|1
18_34.wav|It's a 1440p OLED, USB type C, still has a headphone jack.|1
18_37.wav|And I said as much in my original review back in 2018.|1
18_38.wav|Now, is it still Samsung software?|1
18_40.wav|But at this point there are so many features jammed in here that it's kind of undeniable the utility.|1
18_41.wav|And yeah, people are totally willing to live with it as long as you know what you're getting into with a Samsung phone.|1
18_42.wav|Fun fact, this is also the year that Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Home, a small Weber grill shaped speaker.|1
137_0.wav|feeling the energy from the crowd, but you're not paying courtside prices.|1
137_1.wav|You'd probably pay, this is a total guess, 10, 20 bucks to watch an NBA game courtside or have some subscription to do that.|1
137_2.wav|I would totally do that and it would be fun.|1
137_4.wav|There is a digital crown on the side that actually lets you spin it clockwise to move in more immersion and fully envelop you in the VR environment.|1
137_5.wav|Or you can turn it counterclockwise to bring in more of your real world environment with pass through in your peripheral vision.|1
137_7.wav|And then there was also this kind of weird feature where you can take 3D photos and videos with the cameras built into the headset itself.|1
137_8.wav|And I did not like this one.|1
137_9.wav|So there was a demo of like a recording from a headset camera of a kid blowing out some candles on a birthday cake, basically.|1
137_10.wav|And I got to watch this actual scene in the actual Apple headset.|1
137_11.wav|So because there's two cameras like front facing there, they can record stereoscopic 3D.|1
137_13.wav|And in that moment, sit down and record a super immersive video.|1
137_16.wav|What kind of memory is that for the other people around you, you know?|1
137_21.wav|So alright, the number one question I've gotten after I've actually tried this thing is, is it any good?|1
137_25.wav|Now, of course, it's going to be up to developers to really make it good, but I think the foundational, like, how do you use it part is pretty amazing.|1
137_26.wav|But that doesn't mean there aren't any downsides.|1
137_27.wav|All right, number one, there was no haptics, of course, because you don't have controllers.|1
137_28.wav|You're just doing everything with your hands in the air.|1
137_29.wav|There's no way to have any sort of haptic feedback.|1
137_30.wav|There was a demo that I did where I stuck my hand out, a wall on the other side of the room opened up, and a dinosaur was back there, and a butterfly flew out.|1
137_31.wav|I held out my hand, and the butterfly flew up and landed on my finger.|1
137_32.wav|it could track and see all of that information and the volumetric, all the computation to make that happen was amazing.|1
127_1.wav|It's the easiest, best foldable to use when it's closed.|1
127_2.wav|But unfortunately, it does have a much lower ranking for using it while open.|1
127_3.wav|So the front screen is 5.8 inches diagonally.|1
127_4.wav|It's got these curved edges you can see, and it's actually fairly thin bezels all the way around.|1
127_5.wav|The rails all the way around the phone itself and the hinge are stainless steel.|1
127_8.wav|It's just bordering on a little bit thicker than the thickest normal phone you can get.|1
127_9.wav|I think the number is like 12 millimeters total.|1
127_10.wav|You can see there's no air gap in the middle.|1
127_11.wav|So honestly, yeah, I've spent a lot of time using the outside screen like a normal phone, and it's just the most reachable, usable outside screen of any folding phone.|1
127_12.wav|You unlock it with the fingerprint reader on the side, which is also the power button.|1
127_14.wav|This is a 120 Hertz OLED display that gets up to 1550 nits peak brightness.|1
127_15.wav|So it's plenty visible outside.|1
127_16.wav|It looks really good to me in most situations.|1
127_18.wav|This is a premium outside display, which I mean, I guess I should be for $1,800, but we'll get to the price.|1
127_20.wav|The point is, though, I've always said the best foldables have to be usable as just a regular phone, too, and this one does accomplish that.|1
127_22.wav|So then you open up the phone, and then that's when things start to get a little more weird.|1
127_23.wav|So you can't exactly open this phone with one hand.|1
127_28.wav|But once you get it open, when you're in there, you're greeted with an interior 7.6 inch folding AMOLED display.|1
127_29.wav|420 Hertz and also plenty bright up to 1450 nits really nice size It's reminiscent of that Oppo Find N2 foldable, but there are a couple of things to note Here's where some of the weird starts.|1
127_30.wav|So first of all, the crease is pretty average It's definitely not dramatically worse than others I've seen but you can for sure see it if you're looking for it and you can kind of feel it and|1
127_33.wav|This hinge is really firm, so you can fold it up halfway or any angle you want really easily, which is awesome.|1
127_35.wav|Visually, it looks pretty flat, but when you put it on a table, since there's a camera bump, it becomes more clear as it's rocking back and forth.|1
127_36.wav|It's maybe like one or two degrees short of flat.|1
127_38.wav|I mean, you can force it to get to flat or even a little bit past that, but it really doesn't feel good to do that.|1
127_39.wav|Anyway, then there's the bezel.|1
127_40.wav|As you've probably seen by now, this phone does have a slightly bigger top and bottom bezel than some other folding phones.|1
39_0.wav|Are any of these a killer app?|1
39_2.wav|I mean, I don't, if you're looking for any one of these to be the reason why you spend like $4,000 on this headset, I don't think we have that yet.|1
39_3.wav|But then at least there's all the other non-native, but technically still compatible apps that are in the App Store.|1
39_4.wav|And these are gonna look just like iPhone and iPad apps.|1
39_5.wav|Actually, there's a pre-installed folder on the home screen when you get this thing, literally called compatible apps.|1
39_6.wav|And there's a bunch of them from Apple here.|1
39_8.wav|I'm surprised actually that more of them aren't fully built out to take advantage of Vision Pro, but like Apple Maps is just the iPad app.|1
39_9.wav|And so it would be cool if there were some like fun augmented reality overlay walking directions type stuff, but nope, it's all the exact same functionality that you would find if you open this app on your iPad.|1
39_10.wav|and you can go to the app store and search a bunch of the names of apps you already know and love and find them by name and grab them and they'll work the exact same way.|1
39_11.wav|Crazily enough though, there are already some notable exceptions.|1
39_12.wav|No Netflix app for the Vision Pro, no YouTube app for the Vision Pro, no Spotify app for the Vision Pro.|1
39_13.wav|Apple has a kind of a contentious relationship with a lot of developers right now, especially some of the bigger ones.|1
39_14.wav|And so some have made the active choice to opt out.|1
39_15.wav|They're like, we don't want to be there.|1
39_16.wav|This won't be a big enough platform to matter to us to justify the work.|1
39_19.wav|But also now as a Vision Pro owner and someone who's using it, I'm like, oh,|1
39_21.wav|I really wanted to be able to watch like a Netflix show offline downloaded ahead of time, but you can't do that now.|1
39_22.wav|But at least, at least for now, for the record, you can use the browser and anything that would work in the browser.|1
39_23.wav|So if you pull up Safari and you get a full screen 4K YouTube video going and locked in space or even in an environment,|1
39_25.wav|Like I could totally watch YouTube videos like this, but you will definitely be missing like the features of having a dedicated app like offline video.|1
39_26.wav|Honestly, to me, the killer app of the Vision Pro isn't just an app, it's actually the ecosystem.|1
39_27.wav|And we knew this was coming, but the second you log into a Vision Pro with your Apple ID, immediately it starts pulling all the services and all the stuff that you're used to from all the other Apple devices you already have.|1
39_29.wav|I was like, this is the most obvious strategy for Apple because there are lots of people out there|1
39_30.wav|who have never considered buying a VR headset that are considering only this one because they have an iPhone and this is the one that works with the iPhone and none of the others are particularly close.|1
39_32.wav|All of your photos are already here and loaded up and backed up.|1
39_33.wav|All your notes are already at your fingertips.|1
39_35.wav|But okay, easily my favorite feature is connecting to your Mac, right?|1
39_36.wav|So anytime your Mac is in front of you and it's turned on,|1
78_0.wav|will every single year until it gets close to something like these, smart glasses.|1
78_2.wav|So these are the meta smart glasses and there's others like it, but they're going to start at the other end of the spectrum where there's only so much stuff that you can stuff into a regular looking pair of glasses that nobody would even look twice at.|1
78_3.wav|But over time, as tech gets better and more powerful and more miniaturized, these things will get more and more powerful and more and more able to do more stuff.|1
78_4.wav|So right now, this is a 12 megapixel camera with a little LED light ring to indicate when it's recording or taking a picture.|1
78_6.wav|It doesn't sound like much, but when paired directly to your phone and the MetaView app, this thing is surprisingly capable as a little computer on your face.|1
78_7.wav|So you can use the camera, of course, to just take first person pictures and videos just by hitting the shutter button.|1
78_8.wav|Videos are limited to 60 seconds or less and portrait orientation.|1
78_9.wav|But honestly, despite all that, they're actually pretty solid looking videos.|1
78_11.wav|I kind of feel like I might want to use these for autofocus for like car driving footage.|1
78_13.wav|And then you can also start a recording or take a picture just by saying, hey Meta, take a picture.|1
78_14.wav|And so you could see that it was pretty fast.|1
78_16.wav|I don't know if you want to say that phrase out loud very often.|1
78_18.wav|Yeah, it has a voice assistant built in.|1
78_19.wav|So you can send and receive messages through WhatsApp, Messenger, you know, meta stuff, but it's just audio.|1
78_20.wav|Like there's no screen anywhere in here built in.|1
78_21.wav|So this really works best with experiences that can be entirely handled with just audio.|1
78_22.wav|So they're connected all the time to your phone via Bluetooth.|1
78_23.wav|So you can listen to music and these little speakers are directional enough that|1
78_24.wav|at half volume there's really not that much bleed and at high volume it kind of just sounds the same as someone like maybe listening next to you with open back headphones.|1
78_26.wav|But you can also ask questions of the Meta virtual assistant, little AI virtual assistant built into the computers in this little pair of glasses.|1
78_27.wav|And you have to ask it, hey Meta, what's the weather tomorrow?|1
78_28.wav|And then it reads the answers directly into your ears.|1
78_29.wav|And so now I know it's gonna rain for our last practice of the year.|1
78_31.wav|We can also ask it random questions about people.|1
78_32.wav|I asked it to write a poem and it gave me a poem.|1
78_33.wav|It's internet connected from your phone, so it can do a bunch of stuff.|1
78_34.wav|For fun, I asked it to write an acceptance speech for me as I walk onto stage wearing the sunglasses.|1
78_35.wav|And by the time I got on stage, I can start saying an acceptance speech as it's reading them into my ears, which I thought was, that's kind of a fun hack.|1
78_36.wav|So this is all based on Meta's new Llama 2|1
94_0.wav|a lot of Zoom photos and videos, which is a very specific crowd.|1
94_1.wav|There's some people that do that, you know, concert goers, things like that.|1
94_2.wav|But there are just very few people who should buy one just for this lens, because it also means you have to have a bigger phone.|1
94_3.wav|And it also happens to mean that your 4X photos, just before you get to 5X, will actually be worse on this phone.|1
94_4.wav|But yeah, it's not nearly as capable as some of the longer telephoto periscope lens.|1
94_5.wav|I mean, Samsung has a 10X optical lens that blows this one out the water in terms of reach.|1
94_6.wav|I think Apple's main advantage really is just stabilization.|1
94_7.wav|Like they finally do that zoom in preview window on the corner of the viewfinder and they overstabilize the frame so you can zoom all the way in and get a shot in super creeper mode.|1
94_9.wav|But I'm just gonna shamelessly borrow a line from Mr. Mobile because he said it as well as anyone possibly could.|1
94_11.wav|So much of the differences between these cameras, this one, the last iPhone, the Samsungs, the Pixels of the world, so much of the difference between them is software that is hardly even consistent anymore.|1
94_13.wav|Like, yeah, there are gonna be certain instances like exact zoom focal lengths where one is sharper than the other.|1
94_14.wav|But honestly, at the end of the day, a lot of it is going to be taste.|1
94_15.wav|And so, yeah, you just kind of have to figure out which one you like as far as image quality and especially UI, just the actual way you shoot photos and videos.|1
94_16.wav|Which reminds me, I do want to mention this raw max button is hilarious.|1
94_17.wav|This is a button to take your full res 48 megapixel pro raw photos, but it just says raw max.|1
94_19.wav|And if you want a 48 megapixel JPEG, you have to jump back into the settings app, switch it over, then bounce back.|1
94_20.wav|And now the button says JPEG Max, which is also hilarious.|1
94_21.wav|Last thing I got to say though, this new pro phone has an action button on this new pro iPhone only because only pros need customization.|1
94_23.wav|I kind of love the action button, but I also need to realize that it's kind of either overrated or underrated depending on who you are.|1
94_24.wav|Like on one hand, it's literally a customizable button.|1
94_25.wav|Like who even saw this coming?|1
94_26.wav|It replaces the least used button that was on previous iPhones because your phone should always be on mute anyway.|1
94_27.wav|And so then you can map this action button to basically anything you want.|1
94_28.wav|You can keep it as a mute switch and it has the same strong haptics so you can tell if it's muted or unmuted in your pocket without looking.|1
94_29.wav|But there's also a bunch of other cool functions you can pick from, from launching your camera to a voice recorder to just literally any app on your phone you want through a Siri shortcut.|1
94_30.wav|Your favorite YouTube channel right now is probably making a tutorial on the best Siri shortcuts to map to the action button|1
94_31.wav|from launching apps to the specific things inside of apps from unlocking your car to|1
19_0.wav|designed to be an AI assistant in your house with Bixby.|1
19_1.wav|It's been about 2,000 days since that announcement.|1
19_4.wav|Maybe they just want us to forget about that one.|1
19_5.wav|So then Samsung graduates to the Galaxy S10.|1
19_6.wav|This I think could be argued also maybe as peak Samsung since they've now basically just gone full screen to the point where reviews are complaining about the last few millimeters of forehead and chin.|1
19_7.wav|Like you see how the chin is just a tiny bit bigger, but yeah.|1
19_8.wav|Up at the top, we've gone right up to the earpiece, and the selfie camera is now a cutout in the top right-hand corner, giving birth to a whole new genre of meme wallpapers.|1
19_9.wav|Screen-to-body ratio is approaching 90% now, and we're basically just looking at Samsung's best-in-class 1440p AMOLED and not much else.|1
19_10.wav|And now these phones have gotten irreversibly big.|1
19_11.wav|S10 has a 6.1-inch display, and the S10 Plus would be 6.4, borderline tablet-sized.|1
19_12.wav|10 years removed from the original, but truly entering us into the modern age, this is the first Samsung phone with more than one camera on the back.|1
19_13.wav|And in Samsung fashion, they just jump straight to three, obviously.|1
19_14.wav|So there's a primary camera, a 2X telephoto camera, and a 0.5X ultra wide.|1
19_15.wav|Phones would never look the same after this point.|1
19_16.wav|Every phone up until now so far has had just that tiny little camera bump, just a single little circle or oval on the back.|1
19_17.wav|But as soon as you open this box, you're never going back.|1
19_18.wav|Cameras are now a feature on the back of a phone.|1
19_19.wav|And you'll also notice there is no fingerprint reader on the back of this phone because this is also the first one that they tried that ultrasonic fingerprint reader underneath the display glass.|1
19_21.wav|I remember testing it and seeing if it will work underwater and if it was scratched at all, it was fine.|1
19_23.wav|So it seems like they nailed it, they still use it.|1
19_24.wav|But the thing that maybe brought this phone the most into the age of modern smartphones|1
19_26.wav|So Samsung's been throwing a ton of stuff at the wall for years, and now they've just built out this whole lineup.|1
19_27.wav|But S10 starts at $900 when it comes out.|1
19_28.wav|And then they have the S10+, which starts at a thousand.|1
19_29.wav|They also had an S10 5G, which was an even bigger, even more expensive version of the phone with a bigger battery to support 5G radios, because 5G is sort of burgeoning at this time.|1
19_31.wav|I think that actually is why one of my favorite new releases around this time was this little new thing they made called the S10e.|1
19_32.wav|And this thing, you know, it's not quite a mini, but this is where Samsung made a couple little corner cutting decisions to separate the true flagship from something a little more budget friendly.|1
19_33.wav|So for $750, it has slightly smaller and slower charging battery and a power button fingerprint reader instead of the ultrasonic underscreen one.|1
19_34.wav|but honestly, probably a better deal than the flagships that it was up against.|1
19_35.wav|So now on to the next one, Galaxy S20.|1
19_37.wav|Basically 2020 is the year Samsung.|1
115_0.wav|iPhone launch, the question really is, is this new iPhone going to get a new feature that's been in Android phones for years?|1
115_1.wav|Like, are we finally gonna get USB-C on an iPhone?|1
115_2.wav|Are we finally gonna get fast charging on an iPhone?|1
115_3.wav|Are we finally gonna get a 5X camera?|1
115_4.wav|And so just for that novelty reason alone, the excitement category, that's definitely gotta go to Android.|1
115_5.wav|So that brings us to my last category, number seven,|1
115_9.wav|So okay, say what you want, but there are a lot of people who will not buy a phone if it doesn't have iMessage or FaceTime, whatever it is.|1
115_10.wav|And Apple has like weaponized this and built walls around this and closed it off as much as possible.|1
115_11.wav|Technically, you can join a FaceTime from an Android phone, but can't start one.|1
115_12.wav|So, I made an entire video just about Apple's ecosystem.|1
115_13.wav|Hate it or love it, it is important to some people.|1
115_14.wav|Now, the thing is, Apple is not the only one with an ecosystem.|1
115_16.wav|Apple happens to build bigger walls around keeping people into their ecosystem.|1
115_17.wav|but Samsung has a lot of equivalents to all the same pieces.|1
115_18.wav|Like you could get a Samsung Galaxy S flagship and you could quickly and easily connect your Galaxy Buds, just like AirPods.|1
115_19.wav|You put on your Galaxy Watch with a lot of the same features as the Apple Watch.|1
115_20.wav|You tether to a Samsung tab just for entertainment purposes, like an iPad, but then you get a Galaxy Book Pro with cellular internet sharing and wireless quick share, just like a MacBook Pro with AirDrop.|1
115_21.wav|You see where I'm going, it just keeps going and going.|1
115_22.wav|I'm sure Samsung is eventually gonna come out with their smart speaker to match the HomePod.|1
115_24.wav|But on paper, the idea is they are surprisingly congruent.|1
115_25.wav|So the way I see it, at the time of this recording, because this could change very soon in the next couple of weeks, but the main advantages of Samsung's ecosystem would be things like one USB-C across literally everything.|1
115_26.wav|So you can use one charging cable for all of your stuff.|1
115_27.wav|Two, they make more different versions of devices that fit into the ecosystem.|1
115_28.wav|Like there are a ton of different phones and a bunch of different watches and different headphones and laptops, et cetera.|1
115_29.wav|So there's more flexibility and hardware choice, classic Android.|1
115_30.wav|Plus Samsung also makes other stuff that connects like dishwashers and refrigerators.|1
115_31.wav|But then the advantages of Apple's ecosystem|1
115_32.wav|not just in the US, but especially here are, first of all, ease of use and seamlessness.|1
115_33.wav|Like it is genuinely crazy how good some of the continuity stuff is in Apple's ecosystem.|1
115_34.wav|Like something like continuity camera is so sick.|1
115_35.wav|Every time you just push one button to use a super high quality iPhone camera as your webcam, it works very, very well.|1
115_36.wav|But then the popularity factor,|1
120_0.wav|at any one time is 29.3 kilowatts.|1
120_1.wav|But as you're about to see a little bit later, that number may or may not be accurate.|1
120_2.wav|Either way, just hanging out in the Tesla app for a while, which you do a lot for the first few weeks, I learned a lot.|1
120_3.wav|I learned a lot about what takes a lot of energy, what takes a little bit of energy, some of it, which did surprise me.|1
120_4.wav|I also learned that sort of the basic like existence level for this house is like 400 watts of power, just because things are plugged in,|1
120_5.wav|Even if every light is off, it just sort of sits around 400 watts.|1
120_6.wav|But you know, charging a phone or turning on a light or something like that basically doesn't make a dent at all.|1
120_8.wav|Turning on a TV might only take about 100 watts or 0.1 kilowatts.|1
120_9.wav|A computer can pull three to 500 watts if it's taking a lot of power.|1
120_10.wav|But surprisingly, the big spikes come from the microwave and the toaster, for sure.|1
120_12.wav|I think the best way to look at this is actually by seasons.|1
120_13.wav|So like I said, this system got activated in July.|1
120_15.wav|So a typical summer day in New Jersey is pretty awesome for a solar customer.|1
120_19.wav|This is what a summer day looks like in the app.|1
120_21.wav|So you can see the sunrise is around 6 a.m.|1
120_22.wav|The peak is around noon and then this drop off till sunset around 8-9pm.|1
120_24.wav|And on this day, it generated a ridiculous 260 kWh of electricity.|1
120_25.wav|Not all days are going to look like perfect curves like this by the way.|1
120_26.wav|In fact, the previous day was pretty cloudy, so you can see it only generated 65 kWh.|1
120_27.wav|The next previous was better again, but yeah, a typical summer day, you know, get around 200 kilowatt hours from the sun.|1
120_28.wav|And then I think this view is the most helpful.|1
120_29.wav|It looks kind of wild at first, but you can quickly tell how to read it.|1
120_30.wav|It's basically how much power the house is taking and then where it's getting that power from.|1
120_31.wav|So overnight you can see these spikes from the house are where I'm pulling from the grid.|1
120_32.wav|This is actually just air conditioning, overnight.|1
120_33.wav|Then when the sun comes out and the day heats up and the air conditioner turns on, the lights and the appliances, everything comes on, it starts drawing more power, but it's totally covered by solar, as you can see here.|1
120_34.wav|And it's also filling up the power walls with extra solar as this happens, so later in the day, when the sun goes down,|1
120_35.wav|that power draw is also supplemented by the Powerwall batteries.|1
120_36.wav|There were a lot of summer days like this.|1
120_37.wav|On the absolute best day in this time, I think I generated almost 300 kilowatt hours of electricity.|1
120_38.wav|But because of how much the house is using, from the AC to charging the car every single day, frequently I'd use 200 kilowatts.|1
138_0.wav|But when the butterfly landed and I didn't feel anything, there was that moment of like, oh right, this is a VR headset.|1
138_4.wav|Kind of the same way that AirPods Max, the Apple's metal headphones are heavier than most plastic headphones.|1
138_5.wav|There's a reason why most other VR headsets are just plastic.|1
138_8.wav|It's fatiguing to have a heavy thing on your head.|1
138_9.wav|And this is a headset made of metal.|1
138_11.wav|Now it is also super well built, like there is no arguing that, but I do wonder about using it for longer than the half hour that I did.|1
138_12.wav|I wonder if it would be more fatiguing to my head.|1
138_13.wav|That's also actually why the battery isn't attached to it.|1
138_14.wav|That would be a ton of weight to carry on your head, so they connected the battery instead through a proprietary cable, and it actually can sit next to you on the couch or in your back pocket.|1
138_15.wav|And that brings us to the other thing, the battery life.|1
138_20.wav|Now there's a USB-C port on the battery bank and you can plug that into the wall for infinite time.|1
138_22.wav|That's already, like most movies are two hours plus.|1
138_24.wav|Just a two hour, I'm sure people will make bigger external batteries for this thing, but.|1
138_26.wav|And then also I couldn't get a firm answer here on if there are fans inside or not, but I think there's fans.|1
138_27.wav|Like there's certainly vents for fans anyway.|1
138_28.wav|And if you're gaming for long enough or using it for long enough, do those spin up?|1
138_32.wav|But then of course the main thing that everybody's talking about, it's expensive.|1
138_35.wav|Yeah, that's very expensive.|1
138_36.wav|But this is the thing that is always weird with Apple products.|1
138_38.wav|Like I always, you always say it's expensive, but like compared to what?|1
138_39.wav|And they did this with the Pro Display XDR.|1
138_40.wav|They've done this with even AirPods Max a little bit, but like there are several things that this headset does that no other headset does.|1
138_41.wav|The eye tracking, the hand tracking, that's super good.|1
138_42.wav|Even if an equivalent headset came along today and did all of the same stuff that this does hardware and software wise, it still wouldn't have FaceTime.|1
138_43.wav|It still wouldn't have like looking at a Mac and then the ecosystem allowing the Mac's display to pop up.|1
138_44.wav|So this is kind of something that only Apple could pull off.|1
138_45.wav|So bottom line, you know, I got to try it.|1
138_46.wav|I thought it was extremely impressive, but at the end of the day, this is not a product for the masses.|1
138_49.wav|It has the word pro in the name too.|1
138_50.wav|But this, this feels like the series zero, like the Apple watch.|1
138_51.wav|Remember when the Apple watch first came out, the series zero.|1
62_0.wav|The battery life I've realized is really, really good because of how simple it is.|1
62_1.wav|Again, just a Bluetooth accessory, not a whole ton of processing power needed.|1
62_2.wav|On their site, they're claiming like 13 days of regular use.|1
62_3.wav|I don't know if I'm gonna get that, but I was able to get three straight days easy, no problem.|1
62_4.wav|And I'm sure you could probably use power saver mode and get even more if you wanted to.|1
62_5.wav|So it's got better battery life than an Apple watch.|1
62_6.wav|But really the main thing that I learned when testing this watch|1
62_7.wav|is it turns out this is actually a pretty expensive watch in its segment.|1
62_8.wav|$69 is on the premium end for a very basic smartwatch.|1
62_9.wav|It's actually pretty common for the cheapest, most basic smartwatches to be in the $20 to $50 range.|1
62_12.wav|They're all a simple plasticky Bluetooth accessory with some slightly different designs.|1
62_13.wav|So this, the CMF Watch Pro, is a slightly better package, slightly better design, slightly better looking version for a slight upcharge.|1
62_14.wav|Kind of the same way nothing is probably charging a little bit more than you would expect for a phone with the same specs, just because of the design and the nice stuff they do with it.|1
62_17.wav|And I bring up nothing because CMF is nothing's ultra budget sub-brand.|1
62_18.wav|And they actually do some other stuff like earphones, chargers, same deal, extremely cheap products, but just marked up a little bit for a nice packaging and nice design.|1
62_20.wav|CMF in the industries typically stands for color material finish.|1
62_21.wav|It's the name of the company, but it's also what those letters stand for.|1
62_22.wav|And the CMF of this brand,|1
54_0.wav|So the Fold took a very similar photo, and then finishing up on the podium was the OnePlus Open, one of those high-end folding phones.|1
54_1.wav|So I will say, my personal favorite photo, and the one that actually won for me when I blind tested myself, was this one.|1
54_2.wav|This is the fourth highest ELO rating.|1
54_4.wav|It's definitely a little on the contrastier side, but a little more confident with nailing the exposure and having dynamic range.|1
54_5.wav|Nevertheless, it's definitely interesting here.|1
54_6.wav|A lot of people pointed out that the sun behind me, you know, looked a little different in each photo.|1
54_7.wav|It might've been setting, so the background was a little different, which is a little bit true, but it wasn't late enough in the day for that to actually affect the photo.|1
54_8.wav|I think the fact that the 7a is the only one with this little lens flare is actually just a coincidence.|1
54_9.wav|And then fun fact, in dead last, with the absolute bottom lowest ELO rating for this daytime photo,|1
54_12.wav|I mean, you can't really get a horrible photo in normal looking lighting for most of these smartphones, but when you put it up against the others, it's mostly just the darkest one.|1
54_13.wav|And so when you put it up side by side against these much brighter photos, people just picked the brighter one almost every single time.|1
54_14.wav|Funnily enough though, you can absolutely overexpose for this competition as the second lowest ELO rating belongs to the Galaxy S23 Ultra for producing this weirdly overexposed masterpiece.|1
54_15.wav|So, here are all the photos side by side with their ELO ratings.|1
54_16.wav|Feel free to pause it if you'd like to make some more observations.|1
54_17.wav|But let's move on to the nighttime photos.|1
54_19.wav|Low light is a much more challenging shot for a smartphone camera, especially with a tiny sensor and tiny optics trying to take in as much light as possible.|1
54_20.wav|But, you know, computational photography has come a long way, and even in this pretty dark rooftop where the only light source was like 40 feet away from me, these cameras still managed to do a good job.|1
54_22.wav|Totally reasonable photo now following it very closely in second place was the pixel 8 Pro and actually the pixel 7a Coming in third and to be honest.|1
54_23.wav|I fully agree with all of these it's kind of it's starting to get ridiculous How much some of the other smartphone cameras?|1
54_27.wav|It looks like in this one, they literally painted sloppily over me and just dragged up the exposure.|1
42_0.wav|the screen recording works so you can see exactly what I'm doing.|1
42_2.wav|I'm going to go to settings and you can do this when you first set it up, but I'm going to persona and I'm going to hit get started.|1
42_3.wav|So let's refine my hands real quick captures.|1
42_4.wav|This is capturing detail from the front of the headset of the hands in front of me.|1
42_5.wav|Once it's done with that, it's going to ask me to take it off.|1
42_8.wav|When you're ready, hold Apple Vision Pro at eye level.|1
42_9.wav|Keep your arms and shoulders relaxed.|1
42_10.wav|Align your entire face within the frame.|1
42_13.wav|Now slowly turn your head to the left.|1
42_16.wav|Next, let's capture your facial expressions.|1
42_18.wav|Then make a big smile with your teeth showing.|1
42_22.wav|Put Vision Pro back on to continue.|1
42_24.wav|So now I have a menu that says creating persona.|1
42_30.wav|You can choose it to always be in studio lighting and always be in contour lighting.|1
42_31.wav|I'll just leave it at natural and hit next.|1
42_32.wav|You can change the color temperature of your skin tone.|1
42_33.wav|Cool to warm.|1
42_35.wav|Brightness, darkness.|1
42_36.wav|I think I'm around there near the middle.|1
42_37.wav|Next, and then I can add glasses.|1
42_38.wav|So if I typically have glasses, which obviously I wouldn't be able to wear in the Vision Pro, you can still look like you have glasses anytime you're on that FaceTime call.|1
42_39.wav|And then next, save, and that's it.|1
42_40.wav|So I think now, you should see my eyes.|1
42_44.wav|You can barely see my eyes when I'm wearing the headset.|1
42_45.wav|Now I've tried a couple other scans subsequently.|1
42_46.wav|So I've tried different lighting conditions.|1
42_47.wav|I've tried different backgrounds, simple backgrounds, tried different shirts and things like that.|1
42_48.wav|It doesn't really ever appear any brighter.|1
84_0.wav|is wild, but I don't know.|1
84_2.wav|But you know what you can't fix in post though?|1
84_4.wav|You can't AI your way out of a huge 2400 nit screen burning through battery.|1
84_8.wav|And I'm happy to report that I have had really good battery life on the Pixels.|1
84_10.wav|So I've gotten six to eight hours of screen on time regularly.|1
84_12.wav|My only real question at this point is, and I only ask this because of the history we've seen with the Pixel, how long will the battery life be this good?|1
84_13.wav|Because, you know, it could be great for a few months and then start to fade like previous Pixels, or maybe it'll be great for years, the whole time you own the phone.|1
84_15.wav|At the end of the day though, the Pixel is still great at what it's always been great at, which is being smart.|1
84_16.wav|Like there's so many features from call screening to Google Assistant everywhere, Google stock apps getting so good.|1
84_17.wav|And the more I use the Pixel as my daily phone, as I have for so long, the more I just kind of get used to this stuff.|1
84_18.wav|And the harder it is to live without it on another phone.|1
84_19.wav|Android 14 has already breathed life into older Pixels already.|1
84_20.wav|Literally, my biggest primary bug is clicking Twitter notifications for some reason.|1
84_21.wav|Just take an extra beat and a half to open.|1
84_23.wav|One of the new features on this one is when you're in any webpage in Chrome, you can pull up Google Assistant and just ask it for a summary of the entire webpage you're reading.|1
84_24.wav|And Google Assistant, with its new AI features,|1
84_26.wav|And then after the summary, it gives you a few cards to ask follow-up questions about the subject and just keep Googling more stuff.|1
84_27.wav|But then just, this phone gets a lot of the little stuff right too.|1
84_28.wav|Just the little things that make it feel like a flagship.|1
84_30.wav|Like it's got some of the highest quality phone calls I've ever heard on a phone, stuff like that.|1
84_32.wav|And it gets supported like a flagship too.|1
84_33.wav|Seven years of software updates, seven years of feature drop updates, seven years of security updates, seven years of spare parts available.|1
84_34.wav|And it'll do so for the new starting price of $700.|1
75_0.wav|in a smartphone body, but their sales are putting them in danger of the same thing.|1
75_1.wav|And Asus Zenfones are absolutely incredible right now for enthusiasts like myself, but they've already thrown a head fake.|1
75_2.wav|Clearly they're not doing super well either.|1
75_3.wav|I'd honestly be willing to bet without even being able to look into anyone's books that the folding phones are not at the top of sales in any of the lineups of any of the companies who are making these things.|1
75_4.wav|Probably the most compelling folding phone hardware I've seen yet is this Honor phone.|1
75_5.wav|This thing's called the Honor Magic V2.|1
75_8.wav|It has all the right things in all the right places.|1
75_9.wav|It's got a 3D printed titanium hinge cover, barely showing any crease when it's open.|1
75_10.wav|Thin bezels, nice screens all the way around.|1
75_11.wav|Somehow it has a 5,000 milliamp hour battery inside and high-end specs.|1
75_12.wav|Like playing with this phone over almost anything else, over even Samsung's.|1
75_13.wav|has helped me appreciate what folding phone hardware can actually be.|1
75_14.wav|But despite all that awesomeness, it still has those kind of obvious downsides for a regular person to probably not pick it over a regular phone.|1
75_15.wav|The price, it's like 1400 bucks.|1
130_0.wav|folding phone who would like to have some apps on the outside screen and then like a bunch of widgets on the inside screen, you know?|1
130_1.wav|You actually can't even span the middle with one widget because it's treating them basically as two separate home screens, even though it's all with one big folding screen.|1
130_3.wav|So anyway, aside from that,|1
130_4.wav|I really enjoyed using the Pixel Fold.|1
130_5.wav|Seriously, between the great performance and the Google software, you know, all the Pixel stuff, Google Assistant, call screening, et cetera, it's really easy to get past the weirdness.|1
130_6.wav|The other thing you typically expect out of a Pixel though, is good cameras.|1
130_7.wav|So let's talk about this camera situation for a little bit, because as I've said,|1
130_9.wav|So first of all, actually, there are five cameras on this phone.|1
130_10.wav|There is the nine megapixel hole punch camera on the front on the outside screen.|1
130_11.wav|Then there's an eight megapixel camera on the inside up in that bezel.|1
130_12.wav|Then there's the three primary cameras on the back.|1
130_14.wav|So there is all new stuff here and it's a little bit smaller.|1
130_15.wav|So there's a 48 megapixel main camera, a 10 megapixel ultra wide and a 10 megapixel 5X telephoto.|1
130_16.wav|Pixel Fold photos feel a lot like Pixel 7a photos, which isn't an insult.|1
130_17.wav|That's just to say that they're in the same style, you know, the same contrasty pixel style, but overall are definitely a step down in quality from the flagships.|1
130_18.wav|They're a bit noisier, a bit more muted in the colors, especially with the ultra wide.|1
130_19.wav|And it takes a bit longer to gather the same amount of light as the larger flagship sensors.|1
130_20.wav|Also, if you want to see video from the Pixel Fold, I actually shot the entire last autofocus video on the Pixel Fold.|1
130_21.wav|So you can clearly see it's a step down from some of the other flagships I've shot with.|1
130_22.wav|There's a lot of noise in the darker areas of the frame.|1
130_23.wav|But I will say it was definitely easier to shoot with because it's a folding phone.|1
130_24.wav|So I can just unfold it and I see the viewfinder and I can frame things up with the primary camera.|1
130_26.wav|But yeah, it's not like you're gonna go out and shoot, you know, movies on this thing.|1
130_27.wav|I mean, Samsung has had to deal with the same type of thing, like the camera quality of their super expensive foldable phones has always been a slight step down from their, you know, big flagship slab style phones.|1
130_29.wav|This is a step, it's a notch down from the Pixel flagship cameras.|1
130_31.wav|This is a, this is technically a first gen device, right?|1
130_32.wav|This is the first time Google's ever made a foldable.|1
130_33.wav|And on one hand, you can kind of tell that they've at least learned some things from the other foldables already out there.|1
130_35.wav|Like they've gone with this passport sized form factor and they've made conscious decisions to make it thin.|1
37_1.wav|So, all of the windows you might have had open will still stay stuck where they were, but everything you're doing is just...|1
37_3.wav|So yeah, there's a couple environments Apple has built in here.|1
37_4.wav|Most of them relaxing scenic locations like in California somewhere, or one really nice one is Mount Hood with a little bit of rain falling.|1
37_5.wav|They're not quite photorealistic, but they're just short of photorealistic.|1
37_6.wav|Like they're the most realistic digital environments that I've seen.|1
37_7.wav|So then the last two big quirks of the UI.|1
37_8.wav|Control center, so the only way to get to control center is to look up, and you can't just look up, but you have to physically turn your head up and look at this arrow that appears above you.|1
37_9.wav|So once you see that, you select that, and then you get your control center for things like battery life and notifications, focus modes, and screen recording, and pairing to a Mac.|1
37_10.wav|But the other big quirk is text input.|1
37_11.wav|So you might be wondering, how does text input work with no physical controllers?|1
37_12.wav|So there's basically three ways to do this.|1
37_13.wav|So let's say you're in Safari and you want to go to mkbhd.com.|1
37_14.wav|You really want one of those shiny new Chevron hoodies for the rest of winter.|1
37_17.wav|So the first way is to literally hunt and peck, poking the keys on the keyboard that appears in the air in front of you.|1
37_18.wav|So this one is tough because it literally only reacts to your pointer finger on each hand.|1
37_19.wav|So you actually can't type fast like with home row or anything like that.|1
37_21.wav|The second way though, I think is actually kind of good.|1
37_22.wav|It's at least faster, which is looking at the key you want to interact with and then pinching to select it.|1
37_23.wav|So just looking around the keyboard like this and selecting the keys.|1
37_24.wav|And you might be surprised how fast you can type like this if you actually know your way around a keyboard pretty well.|1
37_25.wav|I actually prefer this to poking the virtual keys because I at least get a little bit of haptic feedback from my own fingers tapping together.|1
37_26.wav|But then in Safari, the last way to do it is literally to just look up at the microphone and say the URL out loud, MKBHD.com.|1
37_27.wav|And then it just hears you and goes to the site pretty quick if it's a URL that, you know, you can actually say out loud.|1
37_29.wav|What can you actually do with this thing?|1
37_30.wav|Like now that we know what it is, it's the M2 chip, a computer on your face with the displays and the lenses inside and all sorts of sensors everywhere, what can this thing actually do?|1
37_31.wav|And I feel like the most common way to phrase that is, what is the killer app?|1
37_32.wav|Because that's, we feel like we need some sort of justification to spend.|1
37_33.wav|$3,000, $4,000 on this thing.|1
37_34.wav|Like applications made the iPhone what it is as we know it.|1
37_36.wav|So what is the app situation on the Vision Pro?|1
37_37.wav|So there are two types of apps on the Vision Pro actually.|1
37_38.wav|The first is apps that are|1
55_1.wav|The ZenFone did this too, along with a few others.|1
55_2.wav|And I honestly think the OnePlus Open not only made me brighter, but then it also identified the sky and made the sky darker, which just then starts to look ridiculous.|1
55_3.wav|I mean, real life looked nothing like this.|1
55_4.wav|So here are all the nighttime photos and their ELO ratings.|1
55_6.wav|And now we can move to the last but not least category, portrait mode.|1
55_7.wav|So portrait mode kind of turns out to be the hardest test like this to run because they all kind of do portrait mode a little bit differently.|1
55_8.wav|If you just open the camera app and switch to portrait mode, some of them do 2X, some of them are 3X.|1
55_9.wav|Some of them say 1X, but they're actually like 1.5X.|1
55_11.wav|So we tried to just keep it simple for this test and just open the camera app, switch to portrait mode, and then move our feet forward or backward to try to match the focal length with all of these shots.|1
55_12.wav|It kind of worked and you know, they all kind of also have different bokeh levels.|1
55_14.wav|But like I said, we're just going with the default, the point and shoot that most people will get when they do it.|1
55_15.wav|And the portrait mode point and shoot winner with the highest ELO rating is the Pixel 8 Pro.|1
55_16.wav|This was followed pretty closely by Samsung's Z Fold 5, which I actually think had a better cutout.|1
55_17.wav|And then the third highest ELO here was the iPhone 15 Pro, which I think had the most natural looking blur.|1
55_18.wav|But basically all of these podium finishers have relatively subtle portrait modes, nothing too dramatic.|1
55_19.wav|and then pretty good detail and overall balance in just the rest of the photo.|1
55_20.wav|I say this because the losers here, in this particular category, were nothing like this.|1
55_22.wav|With that, that's the photo?|1
55_23.wav|Like, okay, this one looks like a mistake.|1
55_24.wav|We all actually thought it was a mistake as we shot it.|1
55_25.wav|Like this can't possibly be right, right?|1
55_26.wav|We clean the lens, we take it again, it does it again.|1
55_28.wav|So, I mean, I guess for whatever reason, this $1,200 Android flagship phone in its auto portrait mode|1
55_29.wav|just could not handle this lighting.|1
55_31.wav|Anyway, here's all of the portrait mode photos and their ELO ratings.|1
55_34.wav|Now that we have all of our matchup data and all of our voting and all of our ELO ratings from across every single person for what you guys voted for, for more than 20 million total votes,|1
55_36.wav|So we have our winners and losers in each of the three categories, which is cool.|1
55_37.wav|But if you average it all together, we have the highest overall average ELO rating.|1
55_38.wav|We'll call this one the People's Champ.|1
55_39.wav|And with the highest average of 1660, that's pretty competitive.|1
55_40.wav|It was the Pixel 7a.|1
55_41.wav|So this one won the daytime photo, as you probably remember,|1
47_0.wav|someone who speaks a different language, it will do live transcription and translation audibly in real time as you're having the conversation.|1
47_1.wav|So let's say I only speak English and you're going to call someone who only speaks Korean.|1
47_2.wav|So you have to go into the phone app and download the language pack before the call.|1
47_3.wav|So it does all of this transcription offline with a model stored on the device.|1
47_4.wav|And it seems like the models are, you know, somewhere from a hundred to 500 megs each.|1
47_5.wav|And when you get on the phone, you just speak your language.|1
47_6.wav|and the phone will visually and audibly translate what you're saying for the person on the other end.|1
47_8.wav|Then they speak their language and the same thing.|1
47_9.wav|You hear them, but then you immediately hear a translated version in your own language.|1
47_11.wav|I mean, I've never used live translation this smooth before.|1
47_12.wav|Now, I also don't speak Korean, so I'm not about to vouch for how accurate it is, but|1
47_14.wav|And then of course, the photo app.|1
47_16.wav|This one's not a shocker, but it's also kind of shocking how close it is to some other things that we've seen before.|1
47_20.wav|I think a lot of people will just find that stuff useful right off the bat.|1
47_21.wav|But once you go into the editor, you'll see in the bottom left hand corner, a familiar group of stars that are back.|1
47_22.wav|It's literally a full on magic editor, just like the pixel.|1
47_23.wav|So you jump in there, you can circle things, highlight things to move around.|1
47_24.wav|And of course, it's even more precise with the S Pen, but then|1
47_26.wav|It takes a few seconds to generative fill the background.|1
47_28.wav|And then when it's done, it spits out a few options of a new photo that is just completely fake.|1
47_29.wav|And also, I don't know, there seems to be less restrictions with this one than Google's, at least because I remember the Pixel was very picky about letting me move people around, but I encountered nothing that this one was not willing to mess with.|1
47_30.wav|So the good thing is in the final result, there is a baked in watermark at the bottom left-hand corner.|1
47_31.wav|So you'll know in your gallery, if you're looking at an image that has those stars as a watermark, that it didn't actually look like that when you captured it.|1
47_32.wav|You can also apparently turn a regular video into a slow motion video as the AI generates new frames in between actually captured frames, and that can slow down the video for you.|1
47_34.wav|Again, if it's as good as some of the generative AI stuff I've seen, could be shockingly good, but that's just another AI feature.|1
97_1.wav|So Siri is kind of famous at this point for occasionally just grinding to a halt and not answering questions or just taking forever because you have a terrible internet connection.|1
97_3.wav|Basically, asking it normal questions is pretty consistently quick.|1
97_4.wav|The on-device transformer model is also a bit more accurate.|1
97_5.wav|Now, Apple wasn't actually specific about which SIR requests are happening completely on-device, but if we just use our inferencing here,|1
97_6.wav|What I understand is happening is basically all of the voice processing is happening on device from the S9, and then anything that actually needs to go to the internet to look something up, that's when it goes and does the round trip.|1
97_7.wav|So something like set a timer is always going to be nice and quick, no matter what your internet connection is, because that's all on device.|1
97_8.wav|But if you ask it, like, how tall is the Empire State Building, it'll process your voice quickly, but then it still needs a decent internet connection to do the rest of it fast.|1
97_9.wav|It's also supposed to be able to access your health data and be able to submit health data from just your voice, because it's all on device and local and secure.|1
97_10.wav|But that's one of the few things that's supposed to be later this year.|1
97_11.wav|So as of right now, when I try the things that were in the keynote, I just get non-responses and errors.|1
97_12.wav|But then the one big feature, the one genuinely interesting new thing that stands out to me in this generation of watches as actually innovative,|1
97_15.wav|So it's just this, it's just double tapping your thumb and your pointer finger on the same side that you're wearing your watch to select things on the watch.|1
97_17.wav|So Apple actually had to ship me a separate watch running, I guess, an early copy of watchOS 10.1.|1
97_18.wav|All the new watches shipping right now have 10.0, but the feature itself is simple.|1
97_19.wav|You raise to wake, and then you double tap your fingers together to control what's happening on the screen of the watch.|1
97_20.wav|This is basically most useful in instances where your other hand is full.|1
97_21.wav|Maybe you're carrying something or you're walking a dog or you're cooking and your hand is dirty, something like that, whatever.|1
97_23.wav|It's basically set up to either select the primary button in whatever app you're in or advance through the stack of widgets in a Siri smart stack.|1
97_24.wav|So basically, if you're receiving an incoming call, no matter what, when you double tap, it will accept the call.|1
97_26.wav|And then when you're in the call, another double tap that hits the end call button, because now that's the primary button.|1
97_28.wav|In the past for me, I know if one hand is busy, it's been like a nose tap.|1
97_29.wav|I know I'm not the only one who's done that, so you can't judge me, but I'm welcoming of this sort of solution to that problem.|1
65_0.wav|a ton of phones, this is like the perfect addition to that pile.|1
65_1.wav|I mean, TCL has these special next paper modes in the software.|1
65_2.wav|And when you turn one of them on, one's called color paper, and it goes the extra mile to, you know, turn down saturation a little bit and reduce the extra vibrant colors.|1
65_3.wav|It adds some texture and everything.|1
65_4.wav|It literally looks like your, like your smartphone screen is like a colored piece of paper with like your icons in colored ink moving around.|1
65_5.wav|And then you can go all the way up to ink paper, which goes full black and white.|1
65_6.wav|It seems silly to most people, but when you compare it to an actual e-ink display, that's when it looks amazing.|1
111_0.wav|and you get excited, then you probably love customization too.|1
111_1.wav|So digging into the settings and messing around with the home screen and the lock screen and tweaking things and behaviors to make the device absolutely perfect for you, I mean, it's a hobby all on its own.|1
111_2.wav|Now, at first, in 2023, it might actually seem like iOS 17 and Android 14 are the same thing.|1
111_4.wav|I mean, let's be real, iOS just added a bunch of really good features that are very well done.|1
111_6.wav|And then widgets were also added to the home screen less than two years ago as well.|1
111_7.wav|So that unlocked a ton of customization of home screen setups, displaying glanceable information.|1
111_8.wav|But the more you look into it, the more you realize it's not actually that close.|1
111_9.wav|And a lot of this really just comes down to the fact that Apple, they do keep adding all these abilities, but you're always restricted to doing it the Apple way, the correct way.|1
111_10.wav|And so that's why a lot of iPhone setups still just kind of look the same.|1
111_11.wav|Like even if you just take stock Android 14 from the Google Pixel, which isn't even the most customizable version of Android, there's still way more that you can change.|1
111_12.wav|From the colors of the theme of the OS matching the color of your wallpaper, thanks to Material You, to icon packs, custom widget sizes.|1
111_13.wav|I mean, Android will just kind of let you do whatever you want.|1
111_14.wav|On the iPhone, you can't expand a widget to any size you want.|1
111_15.wav|You can't put an app just on the right side of your home screen for reachability.|1
111_16.wav|You literally can't even place an app wherever you want on the home screen.|1
111_17.wav|It must be the next up in the grid of Apple's choosing.|1
111_19.wav|You can't change the icon sizes.|1
111_20.wav|I mean, it just takes a whole bunch of extra work and a Siri shortcuts hack just to use a custom icon, just basic stuff.|1
111_21.wav|Now, I think the other side of that coin is you can make a truly ugly,|1
111_22.wav|horrible Android setup where you can't really mess up an iPhone home screen that much.|1
111_23.wav|So while you can definitely argue that iOS does it prettier, the winner for most customization, that would be Android.|1
111_24.wav|So then category number two, features.|1
111_25.wav|All right, just straight up, which one can do more stuff?|1
111_26.wav|This has been one of the hottest debates at the forefront of iOS versus Android conversations Joey's here.|1
111_27.wav|Mostly because both platforms at some level launched missing features, but especially the iPhone.|1
111_28.wav|Like you'd always hear, wow, can you believe the iPhone can't even set wallpapers?|1
111_29.wav|And then it was, can you believe the iPhone is just now getting copy and paste seriously?|1
111_30.wav|And then it's, wow, it's crazy that iOS is just getting widgets now a decade later.|1
111_31.wav|But hey, now it's 2023 and they're both very complete.|1
111_32.wav|And even in the ways that they're not, they're copying each other all the time.|1
111_33.wav|You always see a new keynote with new stuff on Android and you're like, that came from iOS.|1
111_34.wav|And then you'll see stuff from the iPhone keynote and be like, that came from Android.|1
111_35.wav|But there's even some new stuff now that the iPhone has that Android doesn't.|1
22_1.wav|And yeah, performance is great.|1
22_3.wav|There's that much less incentive for Qualcomm to do anything particularly great here.|1
22_4.wav|The whole goal for Exynos chips was supposed to be better customization and integration.|1
22_5.wav|And while we got rid of that, they can still claim with S23 to have done at least some customization because they've, like I said, they've made it a four galaxy chip.|1
22_6.wav|So it's not quite the off the shelf one everyone else gets.|1
22_8.wav|Slightly higher clock speeds, slightly more powerful, because they've got better cooling in these phones.|1
22_10.wav|Aside from that, they've removed even more character by getting rid of the signature camera bump and making an even more generic and universal appeal phone than ever before.|1
22_11.wav|Just same set of cameras, same aspect ratio, same features, just slightly more battery in both versions.|1
22_13.wav|They're just not making exciting strides the way they used to back in the day.|1
22_14.wav|Which brings us to this year's Samsung Galaxy S24.|1
22_15.wav|Even more boring colors and even more generic design and even more playing it safe than ever before.|1
22_16.wav|This year, it's the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and this chip enables some pretty substantial AI features, which they lean into.|1
22_18.wav|Stuff like live translation and generative photo editing, call screening, and my personal favorite, Circle to Search, is awesome.|1
22_19.wav|But a lot of the AI features are now making their way to some other phones, and Circle to Search isn't an exclusive.|1
22_21.wav|And frankly, aside from just getting flatter edges and slightly bigger batteries, they share a lot of parts with the previous year's phones, like the cameras, the screen resolutions.|1
22_22.wav|They bumped up a little bit, but functionally, the same.|1
22_23.wav|Screen to body ratios, the same.|1
22_26.wav|These phones are all grown up now.|1
22_27.wav|So now we've seen the glow up, the different eras, the plastic to the glass, the iconic to the static, but my favorite way to visualize all these different types of improvements is the graphs.|1
22_28.wav|So welcome to my favorite section, the graph section.|1
22_29.wav|Now, before we jump fully in, a quick word from our channel sponsor, dbrand.|1
22_30.wav|Fun fact, they've been supporting these devices since the Galaxy S4.|1
22_32.wav|Now, they're also supporting all the way up to Galaxy S24.|1
22_33.wav|And I think this year with these phones, a lot of us were expecting to get Qi 2 support, to get kind of like that ring of MagSafe style magnets.|1
22_36.wav|But with dbrand's cases for the S24 series, they all come with magnets built in.|1
22_37.wav|So that means basically any Qi 2 or MagSafe accessories will work on the S24.|1
22_38.wav|So they essentially give you that easy alignment on any|1
82_0.wav|Pro, there's a lot of processing happening.|1
82_1.wav|I do think pixel video is improved over last year.|1
82_2.wav|It's less noisy in the shadows, and there's some nice shallow depth of field with quick autofocus.|1
82_3.wav|I shot almost the entire Corvette Z06 autofocus video on the Pixel 8 Pro, and I think it looks really good, but also in a lot of the shots of my face, there's this artificial|1
82_4.wav|Brightening processing like you can see it in my footage before I start talking when it lands on my face how it just Brightens up my face and adds this contrast and just throughout the footage.|1
82_5.wav|There is a good amount of processed sharpening going on also the audio eraser video feature is All right, I would say|1
82_8.wav|We talked about this in the main channel in the Ramats Navara video.|1
82_9.wav|That car is electric and basically has multiple personalities.|1
82_10.wav|And this one kind of does in the same way.|1
82_11.wav|You've probably heard the other cliche of- I will say shout out to the colors though.|1
82_12.wav|Honestly, the color in Pixel Video is really good.|1
82_13.wav|If you told me I could only take pictures by taking stills from video of any smartphone, I think I would pick the Pixel 8 Pro.|1
82_14.wav|Just the footage looks so good.|1
82_18.wav|So this sort of artificial separation between the pro and the non-pro with like software locking|1
82_19.wav|It was obvious when Apple did it and it's even more obvious when Google does it.|1
82_20.wav|So if you open up the camera and switch over to pro controls, that's only available on the pro phone.|1
82_22.wav|Of course, you can argue that non pro phone doesn't need pro controls, but it's clearly capable of them.|1
82_23.wav|Even if you bury them in settings, it's the same computer.|1
82_24.wav|They also both have a 50 megapixel sensor, but because it's locked under the pro mode, you can only take 50 megapixel|1
27_1.wav|It's not a ton of time, but it's longer than you expect and it kind of annoys me to have to wait in comparison to other watches which will just show me the notification right away.|1
27_2.wav|And I feel like you can actually see the moment that it fires up the Snapdragon W5 and Wear OS kind of snaps on right in front of you before it shows you that notification.|1
27_4.wav|But here's the other twist on top of everything we've already talked about.|1
27_5.wav|I don't think this dual chip system is all of the magic creating this great battery life, because this watch also has a 500mAh battery.|1
27_6.wav|Now 500mAh doesn't sound like a lot, but here's the sizes of other smartwatches in competition with this, and their battery sizes, and how long they last.|1
27_8.wav|Now, if I gave the Pixel Watch 2, which also has a Snapdragon W5, by the way, if I gave the Pixel Watch 2 a 500 milliamp hour battery, do we think it would last 50 hours?|1
27_9.wav|I don't know, but there you go.|1
27_10.wav|Honestly, at the end of the day, I just came away from this mostly just impressed that they actually kept the price of this watch so low.|1
27_11.wav|Because two chips and two OSes and the work that goes into that,|1
27_12.wav|I don't know, to me that just sounds expensive and it's really not missing anything else too drastic.|1
27_13.wav|I think it's competitive in a lot of good ways at 300 bucks.|1
27_14.wav|So I think the clear positives would be a nice design, really classy looking design, nice display, dual frequency GPS, so that's for better accuracy, and then of course really good battery life.|1
27_15.wav|The four days we talked about is awesome, but if you put on power saver mode, it's up to 12 days of battery life.|1
27_16.wav|Now this is going to disable a lot of the Wear OS things, so it's just basic stuff, exercises, heart rate monitoring, but you could get it to really last a week if you wanted to.|1
27_17.wav|But then the weaknesses are definitely the delay in checking your notifications.|1
27_18.wav|The haptics also aren't that nice.|1
27_19.wav|And there's no iPhone compatibility, but you already knew that.|1
27_20.wav|But I would also say the charger is not that cool.|1
17_0.wav|First of all, there was an S8 and an S8+, and both have fully curved edge displays.|1
17_1.wav|So Samsung's realized that this advantage is received really, really well, and they can just keep touting their massive screen-to-body ratios.|1
17_2.wav|Plus, they've refined their edge screen apps feature.|1
17_4.wav|It's out of the way, but it's useful for those who want to take advantage of it.|1
17_5.wav|Then they also tried this new pressure sensitive layer underneath the display right around the home button.|1
17_6.wav|So the display can always respond to pressures in this area, no matter where you are, even while the screen is off.|1
17_7.wav|Now this is also, as you may have guessed, right around the time that Apple was trying 3D touch or forced touch in the iPhone.|1
17_8.wav|And both of these didn't last very long, but they tried.|1
17_10.wav|So now talk about screen-to-body ratio, like we are really cooking.|1
17_11.wav|They also switched to USB-C for the first time,|1
17_15.wav|And then you might've noticed the extra button here on the left-hand side.|1
17_16.wav|So fun fact, for the entire history of every single Samsung Galaxy S so far, they have always had power button on the right-hand side, volume rocker,|1
17_18.wav|And that's still true here, but they've added a button underneath the volume rocker.|1
17_19.wav|And yeah, that's the Bixby button.|1
17_20.wav|So Bixby is the new voice assistant replacing S Voice on Samsung phones.|1
17_21.wav|And Samsung really leaned in hard with this one.|1
17_22.wav|So not only did it get a dedicated button to activate it all the time, but the camera also now has Bixby Vision, which is kind of like an awkwardly specific competitor to Google Lens.|1
17_23.wav|And this is Samsung really leaning into the whole AI assistant thing|1
17_24.wav|for the first time, and I would say to mixed success.|1
17_25.wav|Then they also tried a fingerprint reader on the back of the phone this time, since there's no home button anymore.|1
17_27.wav|And then they also tried this plastic snap-on keyboard, which I think, honestly, might be in my top five worst smartphone accessories of all time.|1
17_28.wav|But even after all of that, I think the most important or the most impactful decision for this phone, for Galaxy S8, was their choice to use Qualcomm Snapdragon chips in some regions,|1
17_29.wav|and Samsung's own made Exynos chips in other regions.|1
17_32.wav|And also to not give Qualcomm so much money while we're at it.|1
17_33.wav|But also in hindsight, this|1
112_0.wav|modes, which gives you super high control over notifications in various different situations.|1
112_1.wav|There are also a lot of privacy features, things like Hide My Email with iCloud Plus, and iCloud Private Relay.|1
112_2.wav|You could even argue that Dynamic Island on the Pro iPhone is a feature if you want to,|1
112_3.wav|But I mean, I just, I couldn't because only a small handful of apps support it, but it's something pretty cool and unique, which is more and more rare than ever in the smartphone world.|1
112_4.wav|At this point though, neither OS is really missing any gigantic features anymore.|1
112_5.wav|They both matured up to this level where they're their own character.|1
112_6.wav|They both do a lot of stuff.|1
112_8.wav|So I'm talking like battery management features to customize charging speeds or set manual charge limits to preserve battery life.|1
112_9.wav|There's also an actual file management system.|1
112_10.wav|So you can drag and drop things onto your phone into certain folders if you want to.|1
112_11.wav|There's gaming specific features like game modes, the ability to dial up and down your screen's refresh rate whenever you want to, independent volume controls for phone calls and ringtones and alarms.|1
112_12.wav|Also reverse wireless charging comes up a lot for charging wireless earbuds without breaking out a separate cable.|1
112_13.wav|Really, it comes down to the benefit of Android is having so much feature choice.|1
112_15.wav|And this also bleeds into hardware too.|1
112_16.wav|So even if the feature you want is a huge camera with no notch, then you have to get an Android phone, right?|1
112_17.wav|So if the feature is a super fast charging, or a 10X camera, or USB type C, as of right now,|1
112_19.wav|So even though they both offer all of the basic features and they appear to copy each other all the time on little added stuff, the winner here again is definitely Android.|1
112_20.wav|Now number three is ease of use.|1
112_21.wav|Now ease of use is very valuable to a lot of people, like a lot of people.|1
112_22.wav|And the thing about ease of use is it often basically has an inverse relationship with|1
112_23.wav|customization and a ton of features because there's this delicate balancing act you have to do of having flexibility, giving flexibility to the user, but not overwhelming them with a ton of buttons and settings.|1
112_24.wav|And this is really where the iPhone excels and has excelled for years as a high priority for sure, even in the most fundamental ways.|1
112_25.wav|The home screen on the iPhone has had up to four icons in the dock on every iPhone,|1
112_26.wav|since the beginning and the phone icon has always been green and always been on the left every single time for 17 years.|1
125_1.wav|Air conditioning, appliances, literally whatever, and it'll be fine.|1
125_2.wav|And when the sun comes out again, it'll start powering everything.|1
125_3.wav|I could be completely off the grid for days or weeks at a time if I find somewhere else to charge the car.|1
125_5.wav|In the winter in the Northeast, you probably already know, we get snow.|1
125_8.wav|Most notably, when it snows a little bit, the snow simply hits the roof and melts.|1
125_9.wav|So it never actually accumulates on the roof and then the solar can continue to work.|1
125_10.wav|I mean, if it's cloudy, you get a little bit of solar, but it keeps working.|1
125_11.wav|And then you're the only house that doesn't have a white roof because there's no snow on it.|1
125_12.wav|But when it snows heavy, like a lot, which it does a few times,|1
125_13.wav|What happens is it snows a ton and it actually does accumulate.|1
125_14.wav|And then when it accumulates, the outside layer kind of insulates the bottom.|1
125_15.wav|And so the bottom now has room to get warm again.|1
125_16.wav|And so it warms up and creates a thin layer of water.|1
125_17.wav|And then the whole thing just slides off of the roof like a sheet of ice.|1
125_18.wav|Like the whole accumulated layer slides off on the water.|1
125_19.wav|So I didn't actually get videos of this happening with my own roof, but there are some YouTube videos of this happening on YouTube.|1
125_21.wav|Literally the whole roof section slides off in sheets and it actually lands in piles around the house, sometimes blocking a door or a driveway.|1
125_23.wav|It was a little bit frightening the first time it happened because I didn't realize what that loud booming noise was.|1
125_24.wav|I was like, is there, is there thunder in the, in a snowstorm?|1
125_26.wav|But then I like see it in the window, like slotting off of the roof, which is crazy.|1
125_29.wav|But then last but not least, the fun fact, I lied to you all.|1
125_30.wav|That sounds silly.|1
125_31.wav|The $0 power bill is actually kind of a lie because my power company ruined it.|1
125_32.wav|Every month for the past 12 months, my electricity bill has been $5.75.|1
125_33.wav|That's just because I have zeroed out all the charges, thanks to net metering, but they charge 575 every month, basically just to have an account.|1
125_35.wav|So let's just to wrap everything up here, my one year conclusion.|1
125_36.wav|This is an awesome piece of bleeding edge tech.|1
125_37.wav|You can tell it's bleeding edge because it's still rapidly evolving over time.|1
125_39.wav|So for early adopters like me who are willing to take the plunge, willing to take that risk a little bit, it can be really awesome.|1
125_41.wav|There are a lot more affordable solar setups out there that are making a meaningful difference for a lot of people in a lot of different situations all over the world.|1
86_1.wav|And then within a week, Google killed Google domains and sold all of those domains back to Squarespace.|1
86_2.wav|So there are no Google domains anymore.|1
86_3.wav|But maybe the craziest recent one would be PixelPass.|1
86_6.wav|If you haven't heard of it, it was basically a subscription plan that was launched alongside the Pixel 6.|1
86_8.wav|And then you get a new Pixel for free every two years.|1
86_11.wav|If you use a bunch of Google services, they're all packaged together, the overall price would be a little bit lower than if you'd bought all of these things individually.|1
86_12.wav|And then who wouldn't want to upgrade to a new Pixel phone roughly once every two years?|1
86_15.wav|And then exactly 22 months after they announced it,|1
86_16.wav|So a month and a half before the first upgrade cycle, they quietly killed the program and nobody got their free phone upgrade because they killed it right before they were supposed to.|1
86_18.wav|The list goes on and on and on, but clearly this type of behavior|1
86_19.wav|erodes your trust in anything Google.|1
86_20.wav|Me personally, I was thinking about maybe switching to Google Fi.|1
86_23.wav|The integration with the Pixel seems cool, but I cannot be sure that it'll still exist in a year or two.|1
86_25.wav|So my point is, launching ambitious new things, which is what Google does, is easy.|1
86_26.wav|Supporting those ambitious new things for a long time is hard.|1
86_27.wav|And this new announcement of seven years of software updates for the Pixel is the most ambitious software support plan we've ever seen in the smartphone world.|1
86_28.wav|And that's what makes it so awesome and so hard to believe at the same time.|1
86_29.wav|Like if I was at Google honestly watching this, I would really want to make this promise come true.|1
86_31.wav|Clearly, I hope more companies see Google's announcement and try to follow and do the same thing.|1
86_32.wav|Because making people's devices more useful and more secure for a longer time is a win for everyone.|1
86_33.wav|For the users, for security, for the environment if people use their phones longer.|1
86_34.wav|So like if this pans out, the phones people are buying today will be up to date till 2030, which is an eternity in the tech world.|1
86_36.wav|So I want to give them credit for an awesome promise|1
86_37.wav|but it's a promise and Google breaks promises all the time.|1
86_41.wav|Will the pixel even be around in seven years?|1
86_43.wav|The Nexus program only lasted five years before they killed that and then started pixel stuff.|1
86_44.wav|And we are on year eight of the pixel now.|1
86_47.wav|But then actually this also ties into another bit of a mini trend we've observed lately that I wanted to talk about, which is new announcements from tech companies that have features|1
57_0.wav|that I actually dropped my phone and this one also hasn't yet been dropped, but it does show some pretty normal signs of wear and tear, but it's nothing too concerning.|1
57_1.wav|Like I always, I always start to get some bigger cuts like this on my front display glass because of my refusal to put on a screen protector.|1
57_2.wav|And these here aren't any more or less than usual, despite, you know, the fancy ceramic shield.|1
57_3.wav|But I do really like the switch to titanium for the frame and the side rails around this phone.|1
57_4.wav|It looks way better than the stainless steel.|1
57_6.wav|And I am also glad I went with this lighter color because this combo seems to show the fewest fingerprints.|1
57_8.wav|Overall though, I feel like I'm happy with this spec that I went with.|1
57_9.wav|Now, long-term behavior, there are three really interesting things about this phone.|1
57_10.wav|Two of them, I feel like I'm using way less than I thought I would.|1
57_11.wav|And one of them, I'm using basically exactly as much as I thought I would.|1
57_12.wav|So first of all, in the camera of the Pro iPhone, this was the first year Apple announced this sort of neat multiple focal lengths feature.|1
57_13.wav|So you can hit that 1X button three different times and get three different focal lengths, 24 millimeters, then 28 millimeters, then 35 millimeter focal lengths, all with the same quality.|1
57_14.wav|I pretty much never use this feature.|1
57_15.wav|I don't know if that means I'm like not a true smartphone photographer, but I just, I always just frame things at one X and that seems to be the end of it for me.|1
57_16.wav|So I just don't use that feature, even though our testing does show that it works.|1
57_17.wav|But I still think the new button they added to iOS 17, where if you zoom in on a photo, a crop button appears and that actually crops the photo.|1
57_18.wav|That's significantly more useful of a feature for me.|1
57_20.wav|But then the action button is another one.|1
57_21.wav|So this is a pretty big headlining feature on this year's pro iPhones, this rare ability to actually customize something on your iPhone.|1
57_22.wav|So I definitely feel like the UI that they built into the settings is still one of the weirdest, most un-Apple like stapled in pieces of UI I've ever seen them do, but.|1
57_25.wav|You can map the button to basically almost anything you want.|1
57_26.wav|But a lot of people made a great observation about the placement of this button when the phone first launched, which is like the reason that mute switch that we used to have was so great is because it was sort of tucked up in the corner and out of the way.|1
57_27.wav|So you could just never even think about it.|1
57_28.wav|Just leave your phone on mute forever and be fine.|1
57_29.wav|But Apple is very stubborn about placing this action button in the exact same spot where the mute switch used to be.|1
57_30.wav|which does mean it's kind of out of the way.|1
57_31.wav|It's a little bit annoyingly not very reachable, especially when you use the phone with one hand.|1
57_32.wav|So when I first got the phone, I mean, I was going nuts with all the possibilities of the crazy things that I could think of to do with it.|1
57_33.wav|First thing I did was map it to Google Assistant since|1
57_34.wav|I never used Siri, but having a quick toggle to the better assistant is hilarious and more useful to me.|1
45_0.wav|and yellow, all matte instead of glossy, which I was not expecting, but I like it.|1
45_1.wav|And then it's squared off, basically exactly like an iPhone.|1
45_2.wav|Now I know, you know, sometimes people say, oh, there's this feature that kind of resembles the iPhone, or it looks a little like the iPhone.|1
45_3.wav|No, these flat sides and the flat screen look exactly like the iPhone all the way around, just being honest here.|1
45_4.wav|But now inside that body, the bezels are again, square.|1
45_7.wav|but that's definitely an upgrade they didn't have to do, and I appreciate that.|1
45_8.wav|And then the phones also have slightly larger batteries, both of them, up to 4,000 milliamp hours on the S24 and 4,900 milliamp hours on the S24 Plus.|1
45_9.wav|And then the big dog, the S24 Ultra, is actually even more tweaked.|1
45_10.wav|So again, it looks similar obviously, but it's trimmed up just a tiny bit.|1
45_12.wav|And then these side rails are now titanium instead of aluminum.|1
45_14.wav|And the display up at the front is now completely 100% flat from corner to corner.|1
45_17.wav|And there's actually much less bezels all the way around and the screen goes to the very edges.|1
45_18.wav|And then also the ultra is matte in all of its new colors, black like usual, but a new titanium color and a violet.|1
45_20.wav|Then on the inside, they're all running the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip across the board.|1
45_22.wav|The cameras appear to be more or less the same as last year with the S24 and S24 Plus.|1
45_23.wav|But the S24 Ultra, they've shook it up just a little bit.|1
45_24.wav|So the Ultra phone, we've gotten used to having this space zoom.|1
45_25.wav|So it was the 200 megapixel main camera, but then it had two telephotos.|1
45_27.wav|But with this new S24 Ultra, you still get the 200 megapixel main camera, but then a 3x telephoto, and then a new 5x telephoto, which is kind of curious.|1
45_28.wav|But I actually think it makes sense here.|1
45_29.wav|Basically, the 10x is a huge jump of zoom.|1
45_30.wav|And I think Samsung is realizing not a lot of people are actually zooming into 10x.|1
45_32.wav|So instead of having a 10x telephoto lens, which was only 10 megapixels, this new redesigned 5x is 50 megapixels.|1
45_33.wav|So the 5x, you know, that's a much more common zoom range.|1
81_0.wav|a way with software to get more information out of this camera in order to be able to use it for secure unlock for things like banking apps and logging into things.|1
81_1.wav|So basically instead of adding more hardware up front like an infrared camera or a dot projector or radar, if you remember that, they just|1
81_2.wav|Fix it in post with software magic and it's convenient.|1
81_3.wav|But then number two, the fingerprint reader has not improved.|1
81_4.wav|So remember we were talking about this in the past few years of pixels, all the best, the highest end flagships feels like they all have that super fast ultrasonic fingerprint reader.|1
81_5.wav|This one is still optical and still just a little bit, just a beat slower than the high-end ones.|1
81_6.wav|It's not horrible, but you can tell it's not as fast or as consistently accurate with like rain on your phone as something like a Samsung phone.|1
81_8.wav|But hey, as long as we're talking about the Pixel, we might as well just get right into talking about the camera because this is where you're gonna see the fix-it-in-post pushed to its absolute maximum, more than any other phone.|1
81_9.wav|So the new camera sensors across the board, they do plenty of heavy lifting, of course.|1
81_10.wav|It's a big 50 megapixel primary sensor shared across both the 8 and the 8 Pro, F1.7, OIS,|1
81_11.wav|And pixel photos, they look good.|1
81_12.wav|They're sharp, there's tons of dynamic range as expected, autofocus is really fast, and you can get a pretty shallow depth of field with close-up subjects, which is nice.|1
81_13.wav|But really, most of what you're looking at when you look at a pixel photo or video is software.|1
81_14.wav|So the multiple exposures blended together into a single HDR shot,|1
81_15.wav|the strategic relighting of recognized faces.|1
81_16.wav|I also, I do feel like there's a little extra noise reduction this year.|1
81_17.wav|So sometimes details get kind of watercolor-y, but at least there's enough resolution that it doesn't look terrible when zoomed out.|1
81_18.wav|And I've also found there is definitely a tendency to over HDR some images sometimes.|1
81_19.wav|And when it comes to features, well, oh my God, there are so many now.|1
81_20.wav|You probably already know about magic eraser.|1
81_22.wav|You've taken a photo and someone's in the background, you want to get rid of them, boom.|1
81_25.wav|You have a photo where someone's moving a little too fast or the hands were shaky and the face is kind of blurry.|1
81_26.wav|Well, there's a feature called face unblur, literally fix it in post.|1
81_27.wav|And then even this new one called best take, people with kids are gonna love this one.|1
81_28.wav|Basically, you know how you, anytime you take a group photo where there's like five or six people in the photo, you just blast, you just take a bunch of pictures and|1
81_29.wav|Inevitably one person's face, they're either blinking or sneezing or something.|1
81_31.wav|But this feature will let you go into that group shot.|1
81_32.wav|And this is for any group shot you've ever taken in your Google Photos library, by the way, not just shot on the Pixel.|1
81_33.wav|And it automatically recognizes the burst of photos and lets you pick the best face from the whole burst on each person in the photo with surprisingly impressive accuracy.|1
81_34.wav|You will genuinely never have that one person with their eyes closed or looking the wrong way in a group photo ever again.|1
81_35.wav|Guess that makes her holiday cards that much easier, but also even in videos, you know I've taken a lot of videos on the pixel 8 and 8|1
32_0.wav|put the resources in, but yeah, four or five versus seven.|1
32_1.wav|So is this a flagship killer?|1
32_2.wav|Well, that just depends on your definition of a flagship, doesn't it?|1
32_3.wav|I think this is probably the most compelling thing about this phone is going to be how competitively priced it is, because it's very similar in a lot of ways to let's call it S24 Ultra, right?|1
32_4.wav|But I've seen this phone, the 16 gigs of RAM, half terabyte version for 899 on their site,|1
32_6.wav|So if you're going with 699 and this phone starts at 1300 bucks, then yeah, that is a damn good deal.|1
32_7.wav|So yeah, I'd just be looking at what's important to you.|1
32_9.wav|But for everything else, like for performance, for a great screen, for incredible battery, super fast charging, ultra smooth, like this phone is better than you.|1
117_0.wav|and I've run all the numbers and I have a lot of thoughts about them.|1
117_2.wav|So first of all, for those familiar, there are a lot of options for solar systems at home.|1
117_4.wav|But there are a lot of different companies who make solar systems to power all the electrical needs of a home, including an electric car.|1
117_5.wav|So I know I wanted to do this for a while since the whole point for me was to be able to drive electric for the foreseeable future and actually be able to know|1
117_6.wav|that the energy is coming from a sustainable source, the sun.|1
117_7.wav|But first, it's actually important to understand that a big part, a big part of this solar system is batteries as well.|1
117_8.wav|So a normal house is connected to the electrical grid.|1
117_9.wav|And whenever something in the house, whether it's a light bulb or a computer or an appliance, calls for electricity, it pulls from the grid and spins up a meter on the side of the house that tallies how much you've pulled.|1
117_10.wav|Then at the end of the month, you get billed for how much electricity you've used.|1
117_12.wav|Now, if you just add solar panels to this house, when the sun shines during the day on those tiles, it can use that electricity to directly power things in the house.|1
117_13.wav|Now, of course, if it's cloudy or if you have a bunch of stuff on all at once and the demand is more than the power from the sun is providing,|1
117_14.wav|then it'll pull the rest of what it needs from the grid and spin the meter as well.|1
117_15.wav|But most importantly, as soon as the sun goes down, the electricity generated goes to zero.|1
117_16.wav|And it just so happens that most people come home from work as the sun is going down, and that's when they turn on all the lights and do the laundry and charge the car, etc.|1
117_19.wav|Now, that's actually fine for most people because if the goal, which a lot of people's goal is, is to have a $0 electricity bill, then this can actually be accomplished.|1
117_20.wav|because the power company will hopefully, depending on where you live, but ideally be running something called net metering.|1
117_23.wav|Well, that's when batteries come in.|1
117_24.wav|So add battery storage to this system and now the loop is complete.|1
117_25.wav|So when the sun shines during the day and you're not home, it fills up the batteries, effectively storing sunshine energy.|1
117_27.wav|So with a system like this, you can theoretically not just have a $0 power|1
11_1.wav|Back in these days, you could see a meaningful difference in battery life, just if you set a wallpaper with a bunch of black in it, because the pixels didn't have to light up on the OLED, and that was a new concept back then.|1
11_2.wav|It's also only a 1,500 milliampere battery, so every bit of savings you can get means a lot.|1
11_3.wav|Also, of course, this was back in the day when you could just pop the back off any phone.|1
11_4.wav|and just take the battery out, swap it out at any moment.|1
11_5.wav|Have two batteries if you want to, swap them in and out real quick while the others are charging.|1
11_6.wav|We will witness the death of this feature during this video.|1
11_7.wav|But then using this phone now, like, okay, it feels slow, obviously, but it's not really in the laggy or unresponsive way.|1
11_9.wav|slow, like there's a lot of solid waiting for anything to happen, especially heavier stuff like the web browser or opening the camera.|1
11_10.wav|You just have to slow down a little bit, give it a second.|1
11_11.wav|Even though this launched with what at the time was the fastest graphics processing of any smartphone, thanks to a Samsung made chip inside.|1
11_12.wav|Oh, and speaking of cameras, it launched with a single five megapixel camera on the back.|1
11_13.wav|which was capable of shooting actually 720p video right out the box.|1
11_14.wav|It asks for a memory card to do a lot of things like shooting videos because it only comes with two or four gigs of storage out the box, but there's a micro SD card expandable storage slot in the back of the phone.|1
11_17.wav|So I never used one of these phones, but my favorite thing about it now is it's kind of got the modern shape already.|1
11_18.wav|It has like kind of flat sides and a flat back.|1
11_20.wav|There is a small bump in the plastic actually over the rear facing speaker because it was common to put your phone down on a table or something.|1
11_21.wav|And without that bump, it would block the speaker.|1
11_22.wav|And so that bump literally is just to keep the speaker open so you can always hear your sound.|1
11_23.wav|Now you remember how I was saying Samsung will kind of just try anything.|1
11_25.wav|Like this first ever Galaxy S launched with, like I said, over a dozen variants.|1
11_26.wav|And so you might recognize this one as the Samsung Galaxy S Stratosphere.|1
11_27.wav|And you can tell because this is the one with the little Verizon stamp on its forehead here.|1
11_28.wav|but you might've had the Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant.|1
11_29.wav|That's what it'd be called if you got the variant that was made for T-Mobile, or the Samsung Galaxy S Epic 4G, which is what they call the one that launched on Sprint.|1
11_32.wav|Little did they know this would be the beginning of a whole empire.|1
11_33.wav|So the sequel, the first sequel is a Samsung Galaxy S2.|1
11_36.wav|This phone is notably bigger and noticeably sleeker than the first Galaxy S. And these were back in the days where the percentage increases year over year with some of the stuff they did was crazy on paper.|1
11_37.wav|Like this went from a one gigahertz chip to a 1.2 gigahertz dual core chip.|1
98_2.wav|I know that I kind of have to give it a second once I raise to wake and then double tap, but it's consistent.|1
98_5.wav|So they have to be able to control it with just their one hand.|1
98_6.wav|And so it had double pinch, it had single pinch, it had clenching your fist and double clenching your fist.|1
98_7.wav|From my limited experience, because I turned it on and tried it on other watches, it works pretty well when you're very deliberate about it.|1
98_8.wav|But the official reason why this double tap is new, and therefore only available on these newest generations of watches and not the older ones,|1
98_9.wav|is the most Apple thing ever.|1
98_12.wav|Yeah, convenient.|1
98_13.wav|So this is coming, this is a in a month thing.|1
98_15.wav|They're usually pretty good about delivering on promises like that.|1
98_16.wav|But as of right now, this is not shipping with the watch.|1
98_17.wav|Either way, this is something both useful and clearly foreshadowing to the upcoming Apple Vision Pro, whose primary gesture will be selecting things by putting your thumb and index finger together.|1
98_18.wav|Honestly, it's one of the most fascinating things about this watch.|1
98_19.wav|But the other fascinating thing is that paired with one of these sport bands, the Apple Watch is Apple's first fully carbon neutral product.|1
98_21.wav|That might be the most impressive thing about this entire watch.|1
98_22.wav|That includes all of the materials, energy, and emissions used to create it.|1
98_23.wav|assemble it, package it, ship it to your door, and it accounts for all of the energy that it actually takes to run the device for the lifetime of you owning it.|1
98_25.wav|That is extremely impressive.|1
98_26.wav|I'm kind of taking their word for it on their face.|1
98_27.wav|I do want to dig more into this later, but it's also something that I hope other companies start to copy.|1
98_29.wav|You know that thing Apple's done in other product categories where they'll have a big silicon upgrade in the same old design as before and then the next generation they'll actually update the design of the product.|1
98_30.wav|They've done this with the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, other stuff.|1
98_31.wav|I'm thinking and I'm hoping that to line up with rumors that that's exactly what's happening with the Apple Watch.|1
98_32.wav|This is what we've been wanting for a while.|1
98_34.wav|This watch looks basically exactly the same as last year.|1
98_35.wav|And that one looked just like the year before, which looked just like the year before that and the year before that.|1
72_0.wav|strolling into a store or going online and choosing to buy one of these.|1
72_1.wav|So, first things first, the details of this phone.|1
72_2.wav|So, this is a super high-end phone in every way, and the design is particularly well considered.|1
72_3.wav|You can see it's basically the same size as a normal phone on the outside.|1
72_4.wav|This is a 6.3 inch, 20 by 9 cover display, just over 1080p, it's LTPO down to 10 hertz,|1
72_5.wav|and it's an absurdly bright 2,800 nits max brightness between these pretty thin bezels.|1
72_6.wav|So this actually does take the crown now for the brightest display I have ever seen in a smartphone.|1
72_7.wav|Now I'm gonna go ahead and give it the co-crown for best foldable to use while closed alongside the Pixel Fold.|1
72_8.wav|So I still think the Pixel Fold has, it's more reachable, it has better button placement since it's a bit shorter,|1
72_9.wav|But there's no question this feels like a flagship phone on the outside, even if you never even open the thing.|1
72_10.wav|There's also a bunch of design touches I really like.|1
72_11.wav|The flat sides all the way around, super clean.|1
72_12.wav|The alert slider is also back.|1
72_13.wav|So it's way up there at the top of the phone, which is kind of tough to reach, but I love that it works exactly as you'd expect.|1
72_14.wav|Same as previous OnePlus phones that had it.|1
72_15.wav|And the power button also doubles as a fingerprint reader, which we've seen with lots of these folds as well.|1
72_19.wav|I'm not the biggest fake leather on the back of a phone person.|1
72_20.wav|It gives me like Samsung 2016 vibes.|1
72_25.wav|But really the feature is the gigantic camera bump.|1
72_27.wav|But it also happens to be exactly where my index finger rests on the back of the phone.|1
72_28.wav|So it's like a nice little shelf that feels really natural when using the phone while closed.|1
72_30.wav|Also the LED flash, I guess it couldn't fit.|1
72_31.wav|So they shoved it up in the corner for some reason.|1
72_32.wav|But then you open this thing up and it just it becomes so obvious why they waited so long to do their first foldable.|1
72_33.wav|It looks nothing like some of the other first gen folding screens from years ago.|1
72_34.wav|It's got this huge 7.8 inch corner to corner LTPO 3.0 display that again goes up to 2800 nits and down to 1 hertz.|1
72_35.wav|even bezels all the way around, got the hole punch in the top corner, and honestly, one of the least visible creases you will see in a folding phone in 2023.|1
72_36.wav|Now, I think it's actually debatable if we can technically call this their first foldable phone, because while OnePlus hasn't made a foldable yet, their sister company, Oppo, clearly has.|1
72_37.wav|So I wouldn't be surprised if this took a lot of tech from them.|1
72_38.wav|Actually, there is another just released Oppo phone called the Oppo Find N3, and it's the same as this.|1
72_40.wav|With this screen on, you literally don't see the crease at all.|1
72_41.wav|And screen off, you still kind of have to look for it.|1
72_42.wav|And then, yeah, you hit the angle where the light reflects off of the middle of the phone, and then you can see it.|1
72_43.wav|But this is one of those phones that looks really good from almost every angle you would actually use it.|1
72_44.wav|And then it also has one of those hinges that stays at whatever|1
132_1.wav|I don't know if you remember the the hair dryer that's been in the studio which was wrapped in the original robot skin.|1
132_2.wav|So this new one, Robot City, if you can look closely you'll see it actually there are three different versions that you can choose from that are all these unique discrete pieces of art.|1
20_0.wav|that they were going to sync up the year of the calendar with the year of the phone.|1
20_1.wav|So we have S20 in 2020.|1
20_2.wav|I'm sure that has nothing to do with the fact that the number was always slightly behind the flagship iPhone.|1
20_3.wav|But now this Galaxy S20 looks blank, boring, soulless.|1
20_6.wav|It feels like this is a complete blank phone.|1
20_7.wav|Like if you put the S10 next to the S20 and then not to jump too far forward, but the S21, it looks like they took a year off with the S20.|1
20_8.wav|Like this might be the most generic phone of all time.|1
20_9.wav|Now to be fair, there are other phones that have looked like this.|1
20_10.wav|And again, this is Samsung's flagship for years and we know they're gonna start to play it safe.|1
20_11.wav|But in hindsight, this one is pretty dull.|1
20_12.wav|It also happens to be the first ever Galaxy S since the very beginning to move the volume rocker to the right side.|1
20_14.wav|It also is the first one to not say the model number on the back at all with the text.|1
20_16.wav|And it's also the first Galaxy S to follow in the footsteps of the iPhone after making fun of them and removing the headphone jack.|1
20_18.wav|Now I do love that this was officially the first Galaxy S flagship with 120 Hertz display.|1
20_19.wav|And they actually moved the smaller hole punch camera to the top middle.|1
20_20.wav|And it was the first to be able to record 8K video.|1
20_21.wav|So it's still gaining capabilities.|1
20_22.wav|It's not like the ball didn't move forward at all with this phone, but probably the more interesting dynamic is what was happening at the very top of the lineup.|1
20_23.wav|See, this was the first year of the Ultra phone.|1
20_24.wav|So S20 is still a regular size phone, $1,000 phone, but they also decided to make a gigantic phone with the most possible numbers and the highest end possible specs and make it an ultra.|1
20_25.wav|And this was kind of fighting at the top of the lineup with the Galaxy Note because up until this point, you know, they tried a whole bunch of stuff and they ended up having this particularly successful high-end phone with a stylus in it.|1
20_26.wav|that was, if you wanted even more than the S could offer, you could go buy a Galaxy Note.|1
20_27.wav|So this phone in this year kind of, just like its design, just kind of got forgotten.|1
20_28.wav|until later in the year when they dropped the fan edition, the FE of the exact same phone, cut a couple things down, 1080p, removed like one or two features, 700 bucks.|1
20_29.wav|And this phone was a great deal.|1
20_31.wav|But also fun, not so fun fact, this Galaxy S20 has also started swelling.|1
20_32.wav|Like the battery has started to bulge to the point where it's pushing the back of the phone off of the chassis through the glue.|1
20_34.wav|I've had a lot of smartphones come through the studio.|1
20_35.wav|We review a lot of phones, obviously, and we've had basically a large sample size of smartphones in long-term storage.|1
20_36.wav|And the only brand that's had more than one smartphone whose battery swells up like a balloon to the point where we have to get rid of it is Samsung.|1
66_0.wav|online, so that's understandable.|1
66_1.wav|But then you get to the stats.|1
66_2.wav|And the stats say the iPhone has somewhere around 50% market share in the US, which is higher than the global average, and it is steadily growing every single year.|1
66_3.wav|And worst of all, 87% that's not a typo, 87% of teenagers in the US|1
66_5.wav|And that, that honestly feels like the most damning one because that means they got them early.|1
66_6.wav|Like these are the, everyone knows about the walls that Apple builds up around their ecosystem to try to keep people in the iPhone walled garden.|1
66_7.wav|But 87% of teenagers, that just means that there's a lot of these people's first phone.|1
66_8.wav|These people will be iPhone customers for life, maybe.|1
66_9.wav|Like for a lot of them, their friends all have iPhones.|1
66_10.wav|And if they're gonna get their first phone for the first time, they don't really even consider anything|1
66_11.wav|that isn't also an iPhone.|1
66_12.wav|It's the only way to get into all the group chats with their friends.|1
66_13.wav|It's the only way to get in on all the inside jokes and socializations that happen after school from the FaceTimes to the iMessages and all the things that are just iPhone only.|1
66_14.wav|So it's a very baked in thing.|1
66_15.wav|It's a very US centric thing for sure.|1
66_17.wav|So this is why when I made that blue bubbles versus green bubbles explained video, I had to put that disclaimer in the beginning of the video, but that's why half the comments were like, yeah, I live in the US and I see this everywhere.|1
66_18.wav|There's iPhones everywhere and the pressure of the iPhone is very real.|1
66_19.wav|And then the other half of the comments are like,|1
66_20.wav|This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.|1
66_21.wav|Why do people care so much about which phone people use?|1
66_31.wav|And as some of you may have picked up by the title and premise of this video, it's a real company too.|1
66_33.wav|This is a company that's made their first two phones now.|1
66_35.wav|They're trying to break out and their options seem to be.|1
66_36.wav|just give up on the US and never, or maybe try to strike a carrier deal and get in that way, but it doesn't seem like it might work.|1
66_37.wav|Or just lean all the way in and embrace the actual heart of the question, the number one problem, the biggest asset of the other side.|1
66_39.wav|So what nothing has decided to do, and they're announcing this today, is they have built iMessage into their Android phone.|1
66_41.wav|So they've announced a new app that is going to come out and be exclusive to the Nothing Phone 2 to start and it's called the Nothing Chats app.|1
66_42.wav|And their goal with this is to literally offer iMessage also on their phone.|1
66_48.wav|This is an app that's co-developed with a company called Sunbird who has been doing this for a little while.|1
95_0.wav|not just launching my favorite task manager app, but launching a new task inside of my task manager app.|1
95_1.wav|It just lets me, it's great.|1
95_3.wav|Honestly, I hope it gets copied even though a bunch of phones were doing this years ago and then they stopped.|1
95_4.wav|I hope they bring it back now in response to how great this is.|1
95_5.wav|But on the other hand, I do kind of feel like for a lot of people, this is gonna be one of those things that they play with for like a three or four days and then just kind of forget about it and never use it again.|1
95_6.wav|And I mostly think that's because it's not super reachable.|1
95_7.wav|Like it's not a one handable button where your fingers usually rest for everyone, especially on the Pro Max, it's way up there in the corner above the volume buttons.|1
95_8.wav|It could be a cool shutter button for the camera, but the volume buttons already do that.|1
95_9.wav|So yeah, I feel like you might as well just end up setting it back to a mute switch and forgetting about it after a few weeks.|1
95_11.wav|It's one of those things that you'll just figure out which user you are after you use it for a while.|1
95_12.wav|Kind of like I've been using the new, that eight sleep mattress cover that I was talking about.|1
95_13.wav|I've been using it for about three months now.|1
95_14.wav|This is the pod cover that goes on your mattress that either warms you up or cools you down, helps you sleep.|1
95_15.wav|Like now that I've used it for a while, I've understood, like I was a skeptic at first, but honestly, this is one of those things where I go to a hotel bed and I have a harder time sleeping, which it used to be the other way around.|1
95_16.wav|but I just sleep so much better in the eight sleep bed because it's cooled down to let you get to sleep early and then warms up in the morning to help you wake up.|1
95_17.wav|And it's become really clear that temperature is one of the most important factors when it comes to sleep.|1
95_18.wav|And it's become real obvious to me that falling asleep faster, getting better quality sleep, and then being able to depend on it is something I wouldn't trade for anything.|1
95_19.wav|It's just, it took me some time to learn that.|1
95_20.wav|Plus there's an app that shows me all my info about my sleep every night and it lets me adjust the autopilot if I want.|1
95_21.wav|If your partner sleeps at a different side on the same bed, they can adjust the temperature in the app too.|1
95_24.wav|And since they're a great sponsor, they're actually giving you guys $200 off the pod cover if you use code MKBHD at 8sleep.com.|1
95_26.wav|What's the verdict with the new pro iPhone of 2023?|1
4_1.wav|And then they send it, they send it all into production.|1
4_2.wav|And you know, reviews, honestly, for the most part were super positive across the board.|1
4_4.wav|Yes, the battery life is weaker on the smaller phone, but to put a flagship shape and a flagship chip and a flagship camera in a mini phone, it's just such a rare thing.|1
4_5.wav|So it was extremely well-received.|1
4_10.wav|still sold dramatically less than what Apple had prepared for it to.|1
4_11.wav|There are some surveys that have the mini iPhone at like 5% of the total sales of the entire new iPhone 12 lineup, sometimes even less.|1
4_12.wav|I mean, it was really, really unpopular in the grand scheme of things to actually buy an iPhone 12 mini.|1
4_13.wav|So suddenly it went from being the darling of the lineup to the least successful new iPhone of all time.|1
4_14.wav|And the headlines were all over this and sort of wondering if they would even try this again.|1
4_20.wav|a brand new plus sized iPhone, because of course.|1
4_22.wav|Like some people think, Oh, this thing is getting positive reviews.|1
4_26.wav|If things are getting negative reviews from YouTubers, that must be why it died.|1
4_29.wav|Now here's the thing, not to discount the Zenfone 11 Ultra, it's actually a really good phone.|1
4_30.wav|In fact, it's a perfectly fine, large flagship phone.|1
4_31.wav|It brings all the good things about Zenfone 10 to a bigger scale, bigger battery, awesome battery life, the latest chips and specs again, lightweight software and smooth performance, rock solid cameras.|1
4_32.wav|It actually added a third telephoto camera.|1
4_34.wav|It just loses the biggest thing, or I guess the smallest thing, that really made it different.|1
4_35.wav|Just the fact that it was actually small and reachable from corner to corner and didn't require huge pockets or huge hands to comfortably daily it.|1
4_37.wav|And now it's just like a ROG phone minus the gamer stuff.|1
4_38.wav|Actually, seriously, that's basically what it is.|1
4_39.wav|This is the new Zenfone next to the new ROG phone.|1
4_40.wav|If you take away the screen on the back, the 165 hertz display, the side USB-C port, the shoulder triggers, honestly, it's basically the same phone.|1
4_41.wav|So this Zenfone just feels like it's blending into the sea of other|1
131_0.wav|and there's some hinge innovation here and it's kept the pixel aesthetic.|1
131_2.wav|Like for the inside display, the crease and the bezels and the 178 degree almost flat fold, like, nah.|1
131_4.wav|For the weak battery life, like yes, there is wireless charging, but hey, maybe the next one will have faster charging than the current max of 30 watts.|1
131_5.wav|And of course the app situation is still, let's just say it's clearly imperfect.|1
131_6.wav|They've done a lot of good stuff with their software, but some apps still look horrible.|1
131_9.wav|You can double tap to the left or to the right to move it over closer to the side where it's more reachable.|1
131_10.wav|But still, I mean, that, that is rough.|1
131_11.wav|Twitter also looks horrible.|1
131_12.wav|My golf app, 18 birdies, also not optimized.|1
131_13.wav|Even YouTube studio is just not optimized for this bigger screen.|1
131_16.wav|Maybe that'll be better by the next one.|1
131_17.wav|So then the last weird thing about this phone is it is $1,800.|1
131_18.wav|So of course that price is out pretty much anyone who's just gonna like walk into a store casually and just get a normal upgrade for their phone.|1
131_19.wav|It will be relegated to the early adopters, the enthusiasts, maybe people watching this video and the Pixel fans.|1
131_21.wav|But also I gotta say, weirdly enough,|1
131_22.wav|i really like using this phone i like love using this phone it's got just the right set of quirks and features to that that i like it over the regular pixel which i had been using|1
131_23.wav|And also I think it's specifically because it's so well optimized for using it closed.|1
131_24.wav|Like I keep talking about how it's the best foldable to use closed.|1
131_25.wav|It's got the right set of strengths and weaknesses that I spend most of my time just enjoying using it like a normal phone closed.|1
131_26.wav|And then every once in a while, my 20, 30, 40% of the time that I open it up and use it,|1
131_27.wav|It's just this whole new world and it's a nice benefit.|1
131_28.wav|It's getting closer to that ideal folding phone for me.|1
131_30.wav|It's also Android 14 coming up soon.|1
131_31.wav|Five years of promise security updates, great haptics, great speakers.|1
131_32.wav|I mean, there's a lot of, it's got just enough upside that I really like it.|1
131_33.wav|I'm sure I'm looking forward to the next one still, of course, but for anyone else who's gonna jump in on this first gen version, just know what you're getting into.|1
131_36.wav|Also, you might've spotted a few designs from channel sponsor dbrand a few times in this video.|1
131_37.wav|This new one, it's called Robot City, and I think it's pretty sick.|1
131_38.wav|It's one of my favorite designs they've released yet.|1
131_39.wav|It helps a lot also on a phone that's as monotonous as the Pixel Fold.|1
131_40.wav|So these sort of designs have kind of become a staple of dbrand.|1
68_0.wav|don't know how else to put that, like that on its face is a big enough risk that many people will never even wanna try this.|1
68_1.wav|But hey, if you're nothing, well maybe this is just enough to be able to say, hey, we're offering iMessage on an Android phone.|1
68_2.wav|Like this is a young and crazy enough company that they're gonna try stuff like this.|1
68_3.wav|So maybe people consider a nothing phone in the U.S.|1
68_4.wav|instead of an iPhone that everyone seems to just choose by default.|1
68_6.wav|Because as this video goes live, Apple's finding out about this.|1
68_7.wav|And his answer was,|1
68_9.wav|Everyone already knows Apple is using iMessage and its powers to keep people from leaving the iPhone.|1
68_10.wav|But if Apple now like publicly acknowledges this as a competitor in the space that they've got to shut down or something like that, it could sort of shine a light on it in a way they don't actually want.|1
68_11.wav|So they'll probably just quietly sweep it under the rug and maybe just point out some security risks involved with the whole thing.|1
68_13.wav|But that's another story for another day.|1
68_14.wav|But at the end of the day, the real question is, will it work?|1
68_15.wav|Will this strategy of offering some iMessage stuff|1
118_0.wav|bill but never actually pull from the grid at all.|1
118_1.wav|You're completely self-sustainable, you never have to worry about a power outage ever again, you won't even know if a power outage happens.|1
118_2.wav|That is the off-the-grid dream.|1
118_3.wav|Theoretically anyway, at the beginning of this process that was my goal.|1
118_4.wav|So there's a lot of different options for solar system setups for different solar tile manufacturers and different battery manufacturers and different companies that will install all these things.|1
118_5.wav|And there's a thousand different combos that you could piece together with different companies, with different offers in your area to make something that works.|1
118_6.wav|I kind of went with kind of a crazy, but also a made sense solution, which is just one company for everything, which would be Tesla.|1
118_7.wav|So it is a Tesla solar roof, Tesla power walls for batteries, and then the Tesla app to monitor and control everything.|1
118_8.wav|And really the main reason I went this route was for simplicity and integration.|1
118_9.wav|I paid a price premium for this.|1
118_10.wav|This was not the cheapest option.|1
118_11.wav|You can spec a much cheaper combo of solar panels and batteries and things like that.|1
118_12.wav|But just to have everything on the same page and have everything talking to each other seamlessly, this made the most sense.|1
118_13.wav|So then once I decided to go with Tesla, then the other choice you might have heard about is either solar panels bolted to the roof or these actual solar tiles, which are new roof tiles that are actually|1
118_14.wav|hundreds of tiny solar panels themselves all interconnected to make a normal looking roof that's actually a giant solar panel.|1
118_15.wav|And that is the one that I went for.|1
118_16.wav|And this is why I say this is this was a crazy option because I did not actually need a new roof.|1
118_17.wav|Most people who go with the solar tiles option would either have an old roof that needs replacing soon or they're like about to build a new house and this will be the new roof that they put on it.|1
118_18.wav|I wasn't in either of those situations, but also this was the way to get by far the largest total array with the most coverage, with as many pitches as my roof has.|1
118_19.wav|And also aesthetically, it looks really good too, I gotta say.|1
118_23.wav|I'm going Tesla's full integrated setup.|1
118_25.wav|I'm not gonna lie, it is quite a process.|1
118_26.wav|There is a lot of paperwork and hoops to jump through.|1
118_27.wav|Also with Tesla's, they've been kind of in and out of reliability.|1
118_28.wav|Like over the years, they've been on and off with actually making this product.|1
118_30.wav|It was briefly canceled and then it came back and there were supply chain issues.|1
118_31.wav|I remember reading about all this and I was kind of worried|1
118_33.wav|the paperwork with the town from beginning to end.|1
118_34.wav|So there was an ordering process, inspection, a measuring process, quotes, you know, filling out paperwork with the town.|1
118_35.wav|You actually when you're first trying to get an estimate, you actually submit your address and they go look on Google Images and look at your roof.|1
92_0.wav|at a new bigger 48 megapixel main camera.|1
92_1.wav|There's also an improved ultra wide with a closer up macro capability and a whole telephoto situation that we'll get to in a minute.|1
92_2.wav|But then with software, there is this whole new intricate image processing pipeline happening.|1
92_3.wav|So you know how most smartphones, a lot of them today have like 48 megapixel cameras and they all bend down|1
92_7.wav|This new one, for those who might've missed it, is actually by default spitting out 24 megapixel images.|1
92_11.wav|And then it's using the neural net to combine them and do a sort of a detail transfer to get you this hybrid 24 megapixel image.|1
92_12.wav|It's very complicated, very clever, and the end result is|1
92_14.wav|It's really right in line with what I've been saying.|1
92_15.wav|So if you just generally look at photos shot on this camera, it's an iPhone photo.|1
92_17.wav|They're awesome with dynamic range and sharpness across the board.|1
92_18.wav|I still prefer and shoot in the rich contrast profile most of the time.|1
92_19.wav|But yeah, mostly the iPhone is one of the best cameras at just pointing and shooting in full auto, just getting results that look good.|1
92_20.wav|Even if it doesn't look the most like real life,|1
92_21.wav|You know, it's doing the classic relighting and tone mapping and everything we're used to from all this smart HDR.|1
92_22.wav|It's all here and a lot of people like it and it looks good.|1
92_23.wav|The improved macro mode is also really good.|1
92_24.wav|And with this natural fall off with the primary camera without even needing portrait mode, you can get some blurred backgrounds.|1
92_26.wav|Autofocus is also really, really fast, especially whenever there's a face in the scene.|1
92_28.wav|And the benefit of the bigger sensor shows itself at night, too, with even longer handheld captures.|1
92_31.wav|But, you know, does the 24 megapixel make a difference over the 12 megapixel?|1
92_32.wav|Well, zoomed out, absolutely not.|1
92_34.wav|So you got to zoom in and even at 50% zoom, you still can't really tell.|1
92_35.wav|It's not until you zoom all the way in that you can, okay, you can see a difference.|1
92_36.wav|You can start to notice a difference in fine detail and contrast.|1
92_37.wav|The 15 Pro is definitely, when you're pixel peeping, more contrasty and sharp when you're all the way zoomed in versus last year.|1
92_38.wav|But that's just when you've zoomed all the way in|1
92_39.wav|And by the way, once you get past 2X zoom, it's back to kicking out regular 12 megapixel images.|1
92_40.wav|So again, this is, it's like, it's a small, small year over year improvement with that tiny amount of.|1
56_0.wav|but then it also came in third place in the nighttime photo and fourth place of all 20 in the portrait mode photo.|1
56_3.wav|The second highest average ELO rating was the Pixel 8 Pro.|1
56_4.wav|And the third highest average ELO rating, again, this is your votes.|1
56_7.wav|It's a perfect pixel podium.|1
56_9.wav|Then I also had to bring back the bang for the buck award, which I did this last year also.|1
56_10.wav|It's basically just most votes from you guys divided by MSRP at launch.|1
56_11.wav|So most votes per dollar, basically.|1
56_12.wav|And so your winner again is going to be the Pixel 7a.|1
56_13.wav|This was a phone that launched right around 500 bucks.|1
56_14.wav|It did incredible on the tests, but in second place in votes per dollar,|1
56_16.wav|It's a pretty good performing phone and it actually launched like upper mid-range price.|1
56_17.wav|So this is a good phone, bang for the buck wise.|1
56_18.wav|And then in 3A, 3B, right next to each other underneath these two, you have the OnePlus 11 and the Zenfone 10.|1
56_19.wav|And then impressively, actually the Sony is not dead last in this category.|1
56_20.wav|It is expensive and it did perform horribly, but not worse, bang for the buck wise, than a super expensive folding phone.|1
56_21.wav|The Z Flip 5 overall average did worse for the dollar.|1
73_2.wav|So it's OxygenOS 13.2 and it's got all kinds of little tweaks and little features that power users are gonna love because let's face it, this is a phone for power users.|1
73_3.wav|People who are gonna love the continuity features between the open screen and the closed screen.|1
73_4.wav|So once you're done using a big app, you just close it like this and then swipe up to pick up where you left off on the outside screen if you want to.|1
73_5.wav|Just like the Pixel Fold, it's going to mirror your home screen setup automatically between the cover screen and the inside screen.|1
73_6.wav|So if you change something like move a folder or a widget or an app on one and then switch to the other, it will have also moved from there too.|1
73_9.wav|I kind of wish I had the option to change that since this is Android and I am a power user but nevertheless that's the way it is.|1
73_10.wav|But then there's also a ton of multitasking features on the inside screen for having multiple apps open at once.|1
73_11.wav|So you can have obviously one app open full screen and that looks good for a surprising number of apps.|1
73_12.wav|It'll stretch them if they're not natively built for this.|1
73_13.wav|but then you can have two apps side by side.|1
73_14.wav|And then you can pick a third app to get in the mix.|1
73_15.wav|Then they're all just sort of next to each other in this triple panel view.|1
73_17.wav|Or if you pinch out with four fingers, you can see all of all of the apps at once.|1
73_18.wav|So between that and the dock with all of your apps and recent files, it's just a very well-considered hub for sitting down and just|1
73_20.wav|Like I feel like when I sit down and open this phone, I'm about to be really productive and get a lot done.|1
73_21.wav|This phone, the OnePlus Open, honestly, as a phone, it nails all five of my pillars of a great smartphone.|1
73_22.wav|Great screen, great battery, great build, great performance, great camera.|1
73_24.wav|It like actually nails all of that stuff.|1
73_25.wav|Like you already heard about the great screen and the fact that they match each other so well inside and outside is already pretty great.|1
73_26.wav|There's also great performance, super high end specs.|1
73_27.wav|Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, 16 gigs of fast RAM, 512 gigs of UFS 4.0 storage.|1
73_28.wav|I mean, the pair of 120 Hertz LTPO displays have a 240 Hertz touch sample rate.|1
73_30.wav|And I mean, the whole thing feels very future-proof.|1
73_31.wav|And then you also heard about the build quality, which I'll revisit that in a second.|1
73_32.wav|But then battery life has also been excellent with this 4,800 milliamp hour battery and 67 watt fast charging.|1
73_33.wav|Although it just skips wireless charging for some reason, which is like the most OnePlus thing ever.|1
73_34.wav|I think it adds like no cost and no weight and no thickness, but yet they leave it out when all the other competitors have it anyway.|1
12_1.wav|It also went from a 4-inch screen to a 4.3-inch screen.|1
12_2.wav|It goes from a 5-megapixel 720p camera to an 8-megapixel camera on the back, shooting 1080p.|1
12_3.wav|It doubled the RAM up to a gigabyte.|1
12_4.wav|It bumped up to a 1650 mAh battery.|1
12_5.wav|And the amount of base storage, I guess you would say, octupled from 2 gigs all the way up to 16.|1
12_6.wav|And it did all that in a phone that got|1
12_7.wav|thinner and it also added NFC.|1
12_8.wav|So it added pieces and now this is an eight and a half millimeter phone.|1
12_9.wav|So this is one of the thinnest phones in the world at the time that it came out.|1
12_10.wav|Now the starting price also did go up a lot from 399 to 549, but this phone did launch into a relative success.|1
12_11.wav|This sold like 3 million units in the first two months.|1
12_12.wav|This was definitely the first one to show up on my radar.|1
12_13.wav|I never owned one of these phones, but I definitely saw it and thought about it.|1
12_14.wav|But then this next one, the Galaxy S3 in 2012, this is the first Samsung Galaxy S that I actually owned.|1
12_15.wav|And I remember loving this thing.|1
12_18.wav|So it's all the way up to a 4.8 inch phone now, which believe it or not, like this is starting to push the limits of what people considered an appropriate phone size.|1
12_19.wav|Cause I remember around this time, there were a lot of phones that were hitting exactly 4.65 inches.|1
12_20.wav|Like that was a popular phone screen size for the big phones at the time.|1
12_21.wav|And anything near five inches kind of felt like weird, like a tablet size.|1
12_22.wav|And here's Samsung's flagship pushing 4.8 inches of screen.|1
12_23.wav|And then the four capacitive buttons down at the front are now just three buttons.|1
12_25.wav|So it's a home button, that's a physical button with back button on the right and menu on the left.|1
12_26.wav|And this is also the first time we got a voice assistant on the phone.|1
12_27.wav|and they called it S Voice.|1
12_29.wav|This is a pretty direct response to, we just got Siri announced on the iPhone the year before, but you know, S Voice, S for Samsung.|1
12_30.wav|They also use S for a bunch of other stuff, S Notes.|1
12_31.wav|So Samsung Voice, S Voice.|1
12_32.wav|Now, S Voice wasn't good, but then again, neither were any of the other voice assistants that were coming out.|1
12_33.wav|So this was mostly just people poking around, asking it to do things, random facts, just,|1
12_35.wav|What turned out to be much more significant with this phone is just this super sleek design.|1
12_36.wav|The whole thing is shaped like a thin pebble that you could probably skip across a lake.|1
12_39.wav|It had a ton of water droplet sounds everywhere.|1
12_40.wav|The lock screen went from swipe to unlock to dragging your finger through this water.|1
12_41.wav|Like it was a pretty strong theme for them.|1
12_46.wav|And the combo of like being super slim and fast and having a huge OLED and S voice had it starting to get touted like the iPhone killer.|1
12_47.wav|But I think more interestingly, they thought this phone was big enough to warrant an S3 Mini.|1
12_48.wav|This is a 4.8 inch screen, like I said, kind of giant.|1
12_49.wav|And so they came out with a one with a four inch display, Galaxy S3 Mini.|1
67_0.wav|in a restricted beta, you might've heard of it.|1
67_1.wav|And there's also a couple of others floating around like this.|1
67_2.wav|And basically what it does is it lets you sign into it using an Apple ID.|1
67_3.wav|So you can just sign up for an Apple account without any Apple products.|1
67_4.wav|You sign up for an Apple ID and then you sign into the app and it will give you as many iMessage features as possible without actually having an iPhone.|1
67_5.wav|So, okay, a couple of things about this.|1
67_6.wav|One, this Nothing Chats app, when you first sign in, is pretty intuitive.|1
67_7.wav|You go through the setup process to create a Nothing account, and then connect your Apple ID.|1
67_8.wav|So, like I said, you can make an Apple ID even if you have no Apple products, and then you sign in, and then everything just seems to work fine.|1
67_9.wav|It's more or less looking exactly like a skinned version of the Sunbird beta app.|1
67_11.wav|And then suddenly it all works and you're a blue bubble and you're texting people with iMessage from your Android phone.|1
67_12.wav|Also, high quality media is working.|1
67_15.wav|But now you actually get that full resolution photo and video treatment as if you're just two iPhones talking to each other, which is actually very convenient.|1
67_16.wav|Typing indicators work when another person has been typing for a while, and they're also working on the reactions as well.|1
67_17.wav|It's not in this beta that I've been testing, but they say they're going to have that around the end of this year.|1
67_18.wav|But then number two, they're saying that they're launching this as an exclusive app for the Nothing Phone 2, so just this phone, and I imagine future Nothing Phones as well.|1
67_20.wav|But then three, this is a big one, and I cannot stress this enough, this could lead to enormous security issues.|1
67_21.wav|Signing in with your Apple ID onto a device that you don't own|1
67_22.wav|is an enormous security issue and it's a huge risk to anyone using it.|1
67_23.wav|Same thing is also true about Beeper and the others.|1
67_24.wav|Because the way this one works, and I've confirmed this with nothing, is when you sign in with an Apple ID, it's literally signing in on some Mac Mini in a server farm somewhere.|1
67_25.wav|And that Mac Mini will then do all of the routing for you to make this happen.|1
67_26.wav|you will never see or actually hold or use that Mac Mini.|1
87_1.wav|And this isn't just Google, this has happened across the board.|1
87_2.wav|But this has happened where a device will come out, but then the new features aren't available at launch, so reviewers aren't even able to test the new features until well after the thing is in the wild.|1
87_4.wav|The video boost feature they talked about on stage, that they said is coming later.|1
87_5.wav|A video night site is also not available at launch.|1
87_8.wav|Apple has done this actually many times with iPhone camera features.|1
87_9.wav|And they've done it again this year with a bunch of stuff.|1
87_10.wav|The journal app on the iPhone is still not there, coming later this year.|1
87_11.wav|The AirDrop transfer via the internet feature is also not in the phones yet.|1
87_12.wav|That's still coming later this year.|1
87_13.wav|And the double tap feature for the Apple Watch, which is one of the biggest new features of the entire watch was announced on stage, but it's still in beta a month later and coming soon.|1
87_14.wav|I've just noticed a bunch of these over the past couple of months.|1
87_17.wav|throw a bunch of patches at it and updates at it, but releasing half-finished games is just not great.|1
87_18.wav|So I definitely don't love this trend for tech and for smartphones and hardware, but for slightly different reasons.|1
87_19.wav|One, just because it makes them much harder to review if the new feature is not out and we can't test it, and then we review what's out, but then a big new feature comes later, tough.|1
87_20.wav|But I guess I'll just stick with the thing that I've said from the beginning, which is never buy a new piece of tech based on the promise of future software updates.|1
87_22.wav|Just buy it for what it is today, and if there's stuff coming|1
38_0.wav|built specifically for the Vision Pro to take advantage of its awesome experiences.|1
38_2.wav|And then there are all the other apps, which basically are iPhone and iPad apps that happen to be compatible because the developer didn't opt out.|1
38_3.wav|And the first kind is way cooler.|1
38_4.wav|So these are Apple's stock apps here that come with the Vision Pro.|1
38_5.wav|And so these are all of course made just for Vision Pro.|1
38_6.wav|So they're gonna have stuff that takes full advantage of what this thing is capable of.|1
38_8.wav|Like it has all the same functionality of any other Apple Music app, but in this super glassy frosted window and shows the colors of whatever's behind it.|1
38_9.wav|and you have the sort of sorting menu on the left-hand side instead of across the bottom.|1
38_11.wav|Same thing with the Notes app and the Settings app, very glassy, almost looking like an iPad app in the air, just rebuilt with this new material design.|1
38_13.wav|So Apple TV and Disney Plus, they both come pre-installed.|1
38_14.wav|which they have built entire environments inside of them for watching media.|1
38_15.wav|And there's even a small collection of videos on the Apple TV app that are shot on a new proprietary format specifically for Vision Pro.|1
38_16.wav|So it drops you into a space with a full 180 degree video and|1
38_17.wav|Alicia Keys walks right up to you and starts singing right to your face.|1
38_19.wav|There's also the photos app, which will let you look at like panoramic photos, for example, in this fully immersive view.|1
38_20.wav|So you can blow them up to full screen and then it gives you a bit of a parallax effect around the edges.|1
38_21.wav|So it feels like you're like looking into a window of your own photo and looking around.|1
38_23.wav|And then there's also some other really fun third-party apps that I've tried that were built ahead of time.|1
38_25.wav|You can look around a real representation of the sky around you or any of the constellations would normally be.|1
38_26.wav|You can look at it a little longer and it'll pop it out.|1
38_27.wav|You can pull it out of the sky to get more information about it.|1
38_29.wav|There's another one called JigSpace, which is, it's a sick app.|1
38_30.wav|I don't know if I'd ever use it, but basically it lets you load 3D models into the space you're in and mess around with them, take them apart, view them in actual size.|1
38_31.wav|And this really takes advantage of how good the placement lock is on the Vision Pro.|1
38_32.wav|And you can walk around and really gets you a better understanding of the scale of things that you don't get to see up close very often.|1
38_33.wav|And then Keynote is another funny one.|1
38_34.wav|So you can, of course, go through and edit a keynote just like normal if you want to.|1
38_35.wav|But then they've built this whole environment for practicing your presentation skills.|1
38_36.wav|So you press that and it says, oh, would you like to go to a conference room or the literal Steve Jobs theater?|1
38_37.wav|So you can rehearse talking to your audience with your keynote slides behind you.|1
38_38.wav|It is genuinely incredibly immersive.|1
38_39.wav|And there's already a bunch more apps like this in the app store already at launch that are specifically built for Vision Pro.|1
38_40.wav|So they'll take advantage of its various strengths.|1
100_0.wav|Okay, some things I've noticed in my first week.|1
100_1.wav|So first of all, on the Pro, the bezels are technically a little bit thinner, which makes the buys a little smaller, but you really don't notice that much after a few minutes.|1
100_2.wav|What you do notice more actually visually is the slightly softer curves all the way around these phones.|1
100_4.wav|Because on the 14, it was so square, like it just went straight to the edge with a flat display, and then it dropped right into the rail at 90 degrees.|1
100_5.wav|On these new phones, the edge of the front glass actually has a little bit of curve at the very edges.|1
100_6.wav|So it's a softer curve into the rail.|1
100_7.wav|Then the rail itself has softer curves than the totally sharp corners from last year.|1
100_8.wav|So I think it's a nice hybrid of making it just more comfortable in the hand with these curves, but still keeping the generally boxy look.|1
100_9.wav|Now with USB-C on these phones, we already learned that you can just plug in a cable to charge an accessory, right?|1
100_10.wav|So it's no reverse wireless charging, but you can at least plug in a USB-C cable straight to AirPods or an Apple Watch MagSafe charger, whatever, and it will charge from your phone's battery.|1
100_11.wav|So that's already pretty interesting, but I decided it's worth learning all the rules and behaviors of plugging things into the iPhone 15s.|1
100_14.wav|Now, if you plug in another USB-C iPhone into your USB-C iPhone, it actually does a handshake where they talk to each other, figure out which one has the lower battery.|1
100_15.wav|And then the one with the higher state of charge goes, all right, I'm a battery bank.|1
100_16.wav|and I will start charging the one with the lower state of charge all the way till you unplug it.|1
100_17.wav|So I thought that was pretty interesting and it works pretty well.|1
100_18.wav|Then I decided to try a couple of Android phones and see if the same handshake happened.|1
100_19.wav|Basically what we found is if you plug into your friend's Android phone who has more battery than you and that phone has USB PD, it will actually act like a battery bank.|1
100_20.wav|But if the phone doesn't have USB PD, which is a bunch actually right now, it's pretty inconsistent and you could end up charging it or it could end up charging you, literally unplug and try it again.|1
100_21.wav|But if it has USB power delivery, it will actually do the same handshake that the iPhones do.|1
100_22.wav|It's only four and a half Watts out, so it's not huge.|1
100_24.wav|But you know, it is ideal for accessories.|1
100_25.wav|You can literally use the cable in the box to charge up the new AirPods or whatever else you wanna try.|1
100_26.wav|But yeah, you can rescue another smartphone in a pinch.|1
100_27.wav|So then the new action button on the Pros.|1
100_29.wav|I was not sure if it would have some restrictions or if there's some things that it wouldn't let you do.|1
100_32.wav|It seems like it basically lets you do anything you want and I'm very happy about that.|1
100_33.wav|I mean, this was a feature of a lot of Android phones in the past.|1
100_34.wav|There were some LG phones that did this, some Sony phones, I want to say some Asus phones.|1
100_35.wav|I'm hoping it starts to make a bit of a comeback here because on this new iPhone, it is great.|1
100_36.wav|So you jump into the settings and go to action button and it loads up this|1
35_1.wav|So the first time you ever put it on, it first adjusts the distance between the lenses, physically moving them inside the headset to match the distance between your eyes.|1
35_2.wav|Then it does a sort of a hand scan so it understands your hands.|1
35_3.wav|And then you go through this process of basically looking at a bunch of dots all the way around the screen and then tapping your fingers together to select them.|1
35_4.wav|Kind of feels like an eye test or something.|1
35_6.wav|So first thing you're gonna notice is you can actually kind of put your hands anywhere as long as the headset can see this.|1
35_8.wav|So there's a lot of pictures of people like using a headset with their fingers like out in front of them, pinching like that, but you actually don't have to do that.|1
35_9.wav|It's such a wide angle because of the sensors facing forward and sideways and down.|1
35_10.wav|You can kind of just rest your hand anywhere in front of you, in your lap, as long as you pinch like that, it can generally pick it up, which is impressive.|1
35_11.wav|So you're pinching to control anywhere in that 180 degree bubble in front of you.|1
35_12.wav|And then the digital crown, you hit that once and the app drawer comes up, pretty simple.|1
35_13.wav|Doesn't seem that impressive, but this is actually a peek at the first really impressive thing about this headset to me, which is it seems to have incredible spatial positioning lock.|1
35_14.wav|And like, it's really hard to show, like have you appreciate this through a YouTube video.|1
35_15.wav|Reviewing VR headsets is hard, but like turn around in the room you're in and like picture a wall or a window just appearing locked in place in 3D space in your room.|1
35_16.wav|And no matter how much you move your head or move around, it stays exactly kind of floating where it's supposed to be.|1
35_17.wav|But when I say floating, I think you're picturing like a soft float, but it's locked.|1
35_19.wav|So now you're in Apple's new Vision OS.|1
35_20.wav|I would describe this as kind of similar to iPad OS, but way more glassy.|1
35_21.wav|And like, of course, with the extra dimension of 3D space.|1
35_22.wav|So hitting a digital crown will always get the app drawer back in front of you.|1
35_23.wav|And then simply look at the icon you want and pinch your fingers together to select it and open that app.|1
35_24.wav|Scrolling is basically as you'd expect.|1
35_25.wav|You just kind of pinch and grab in the air and then pull as if it's on a string and physics let you pull things through the air.|1
35_30.wav|I would say the biggest adjustment is only being able to control exactly what you're looking at.|1
35_31.wav|And I don't think people realize how often they're controlling things that they're not exactly looking directly at with other computers and other UIs.|1
35_32.wav|But with this, you can look at the button to select it.|1
35_33.wav|And if you look at the next thing you're going to do, you're no longer controlling the button.|1
35_34.wav|You have to look exactly where you're trying to interact with things.|1
35_35.wav|It takes a few extra brain cycles to remember to always be looking exactly at the thing you're controlling.|1
35_36.wav|So when you open a window of a Vision OS app, like any one of the default Apple apps here, it locks into place, it's floating there.|1
35_37.wav|It kind of looks, again, like an iPad app, but very glassy, like this frosted glass around the UI sort of|1
16_0.wav|to make it look like the display is like bleeding right over the edges of the device, hence the edge name.|1
16_1.wav|Obviously there's still a bezel, but it kind of worked.|1
16_3.wav|This actually came at first from when they originally tried it in the Galaxy Note, which they had it on one side of the screen, which is some like software tickers.|1
16_4.wav|They literally put like a stock ticker on the side of the phone.|1
16_6.wav|And when it did, they put it on both halves.|1
16_8.wav|and it felt like the flagship thing.|1
16_9.wav|So this phone got up to a 76% screen to body ratio with the S6 Edge Plus.|1
16_10.wav|This is starting to feel like the top of a flagship lineup.|1
16_11.wav|Now, Galaxy S7 was a kind of an incremental year in between.|1
16_12.wav|You know, holding it now, you can tell they didn't really feel the need to change too much.|1
16_13.wav|Like it's the same size, same screens and resolutions, same storage sizes up to 128 gigs.|1
16_14.wav|And they actually brought back expandable storage by popular demand.|1
16_15.wav|So I guess you can talk Samsung into some stuff.|1
16_16.wav|And you still can't take the back off this thing, but they went ahead and added a micro SD card slot on the SIM card tray, which is clever.|1
16_17.wav|But what I feel like they really realized this year is two things.|1
16_18.wav|One, wow, you can really shove a lot of batteries in these things.|1
16_22.wav|People just love the screen melting over the sides thing, so they're gonna do a lot more of it.|1
16_23.wav|So the regular S7 was great, but the S7 Edge had a 3,000 mAh battery, and the S7 Edge Plus had a 3,600 mAh battery.|1
16_24.wav|And then the S7 Active had a 4,000 mAh battery.|1
16_26.wav|This is also the same year that the Galaxy Note 7 came out.|1
16_27.wav|So you may recall the issues that plagued the phone and its 3,500 mAh battery.|1
16_28.wav|The exact issue, the reason why the Note 7s started blowing up and having dangerous battery problems, was specifically a design issue using a thin separator between two electrodes in a battery.|1
16_29.wav|It was just damaged way too easily where wild reactions would occur when that damage happened.|1
16_30.wav|For as many gates as we've had for smartphones, like BandGate, whatever, this has to be the greatest PR disaster in the history of smartphones.|1
16_31.wav|Like, I think by a long way, like people, this got banned on planes.|1
16_32.wav|Like people would just ask, do you have a Samsung phone?|1
16_34.wav|It was literally recalled worldwide.|1
16_40.wav|This is one of my favorite phones.|1
16_41.wav|They added a lot of things to this phone.|1
16_43.wav|thrown an absolute metric ton of stuff at the wall to see what sticks.|1
16_44.wav|Now, I definitely didn't love all of the stuff that they tried, but I love that they were trying stuff and they tried so many things that these phones just feel a world apart.|1
49_0.wav|But the thing that makes gaming phones so good at gaming also makes them really good at media and just being all around really good daily drivers.|1
49_2.wav|What if we just package our great gaming phone for the masses?|1
49_3.wav|And I think that's really, this is the first one where they've really committed to that idea.|1
49_4.wav|Now don't get me wrong, they still pack in the gamer stuff.|1
49_5.wav|There's still a hidden display on the back of the phone and all kinds of crazy specs.|1
49_6.wav|but the pivot is real here.|1
49_8.wav|It's got a 3.3 gigahertz Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 with up to 24 gigs of LPDDR5X RAM and a terabyte of UFS 4.0 fast storage.|1
49_11.wav|It can play Genshin Impact at 60 FPS.|1
49_13.wav|Also opening and moving through apps and just using it like a normal phone is crazy.|1
49_14.wav|It's one of the snappiest phones I've ever used.|1
49_15.wav|Taking photos is extremely quick from the millisecond your finger touches the shutter button.|1
49_16.wav|Even this optical fingerprint reader underneath the glass|1
49_18.wav|It's just overall the fastest, like the most reactive phone I've ever used.|1
49_20.wav|And we know it can handle games, but if you're Asus, how do you now package this as a great daily driver?|1
49_21.wav|Because let's be honest, the previous gaming phones were just so gamery.|1
49_22.wav|So, okay, first things first, it's gotta be more one handable.|1
49_23.wav|Like, yes, you still want a huge display for gaming, and gamers will spend a lot of time with the phone sideways and in two hands, but regular phone stuff happens vertically with one hand all the time.|1
49_24.wav|So, they've shrunken the bezels all the way around all the sides, and it's pretty noticeable at the top and the bottom, which is now looking on par with other full-screen flagships out there.|1
49_25.wav|And that does also mean it's the first time in an ROG phone that they've ever had a hole-punch camera.|1
49_28.wav|And this also comes at the expense of a little bit of that front facing speaker space.|1
49_29.wav|The speakers are still quite loud and full sounding stereo front facing speakers.|1
49_30.wav|But yeah, the fact is there are slightly less insane than last year.|1
49_31.wav|And then they also went and made the phone thinner.|1
49_32.wav|So they flattened out the frame on the sides, again, similar to some other phones.|1
49_33.wav|So the whole thing is slightly more trim, cutting it under nine millimeters for the first time.|1
49_34.wav|And it's still honestly pretty well balanced, even with this camera bump that we'll talk about in a minute.|1
49_35.wav|But of course, thinner also means, you guessed it, slightly smaller battery.|1
49_36.wav|Again, for the first time in an ROG phone, it goes from 6,000 milliamp hours to 5,500 milliamp hours.|1
49_37.wav|To be honest, in using this phone, I haven't really noticed the difference because it's still such a battery champ with all the optimizations Asus has pulled with the software, with this display, but they did technically|1
126_0.wav|massive, huge solar setups as well.|1
126_1.wav|But I think we can kind of all get behind a technology making more sustainable energy, more useful, more efficient, and more beautiful over time.|1
126_2.wav|I definitely learned a lot with this process, mostly in like how much electricity certain things specifically use, but also how much electricity a roof with solar panels on it can collect in different|1
126_3.wav|times of year, different seasons and different situations.|1
126_4.wav|But I don't think, honestly, I don't think I would change a thing.|1
126_5.wav|I don't think I would change anything in what I did.|1
126_6.wav|Other than probably waiting like six months to get a little more of a federal tax credit.|1
126_9.wav|which would be amazing.|1
126_11.wav|These car batteries, as we're learning,|1
126_12.wav|are already way bigger and can support way more power output than any power wall, any home battery.|1
126_13.wav|One Model S battery is equivalent to like seven or eight power walls.|1
126_14.wav|So who knows if Tesla actually does it or not, but as of today, with the right box on the wall, with the right inverter, the F-150 Lightning, which has an even bigger battery, can actually be your house's backup battery.|1
126_16.wav|the number of EVs that support this feature should only be slowly going up.|1
126_18.wav|And you have the ability to be completely functional during|1
23_2.wav|You can check it out at the link below in the description.|1
23_3.wav|So let's take a look at how far these phones have come.|1
23_4.wav|These are really interesting and there's a couple of them.|1
23_5.wav|I think Samsung is the first one that has notable ups and downs in their progress graphs, which is really interesting.|1
23_6.wav|It kind of feels like they're going backwards, but there's reasons behind all of it.|1
23_8.wav|So first up, screen sizes.|1
23_9.wav|So these are the screen sizes of the base Samsung Galaxy S over every single year.|1
23_10.wav|starting at the original 4-inch Samsung Galaxy S, then really quickly jumping up into the 5s, and then kind of slowing down and settling in right around 6 inches.|1
23_11.wav|You can actually see a slight dip where the S10 was 6.1 inches, then it was 6.2 again, then back to 6.1 to make room for the Ultra, then back up to 6.2 again.|1
23_13.wav|Now, there's a sort of a dedicated gigantic phone.|1
23_14.wav|So this rate of growth has pretty much evened out.|1
23_15.wav|So the huge phone is the Ultra, which is 6.8 inches, which is crazy.|1
23_17.wav|Based on this chart, maybe it's not a fact, but you can make an argument that the Galaxy S20 was kind of peak Samsung, because that is the same screen size as today's base phone.|1
23_19.wav|Let's look now at battery sizes.|1
23_20.wav|So, you know, battery life hasn't really improved dramatically.|1
23_21.wav|We're still at a day for a good phone, but the physical capacity of these batteries able to fit in these phones has improved significantly as well.|1
23_22.wav|So you can see it starts at 1500 milliamp hours, removable of course, then nearly doubles by the Galaxy S5, but then it dips.|1
23_24.wav|Then they shoot back up again, but again, kind of flat lines in line with a certain memorable battery related event.|1
23_25.wav|But then they eventually got the courage to walk back up the base phone all the way to 4,000 mAh.|1
23_26.wav|And what do you know, again, you can argue Galaxy S20 is peak Samsung.|1
23_27.wav|That's the first year of the 4,000 mAh battery, and that is still the battery size again.|1
23_28.wav|Now, the primary camera megapixel count.|1
23_29.wav|This one's a little more interesting, maybe a little more classic improvement over time.|1
23_30.wav|Of course, megapixels don't mean everything, but it's fun to see the priorities increase over time.|1
23_31.wav|At the beginning, there was a lot of incentive to just level up from 720p to 1080p video, and then to 4K video.|1
23_33.wav|You know, there's not any reason to go too crazy with megapixels beyond that.|1
23_34.wav|Of course, the highest end ultra phones quickly blasted the ceiling way up all the way to 100 megapixels and then 200 this year, which is nuts.|1
23_35.wav|But for the baseline phone, you know, most people's screens aren't 50 megapixels.|1
23_36.wav|So I think this is a very appropriate plateau.|1
23_37.wav|But then last but not least, starting price.|1
23_38.wav|We all know what happened with smartphones over the years, and here you can see it visualized.|1
14_1.wav|a 2.7 gigahertz processor on some variants.|1
14_2.wav|All right, two to three gigs of RAM, up to 32 gigs of storage.|1
14_3.wav|And it's a 16 megapixel camera that now shoots 4K video.|1
14_4.wav|Also the bottom left button has gone from a menu button to a multitasking button to match the three primary buttons needed to operate Android.|1
14_6.wav|But then of course, alongside all that is the absolute classic Samsung just trying things.|1
14_7.wav|And I think the telltale sign for this stuff is when you see them try it for one generation, just to throw it out the wall and see what sticks, and then it's gone the next year.|1
14_8.wav|Like they added this little sensor back here next to the camera flash on the back.|1
14_10.wav|So you can measure your heart rate, plugs into S Health.|1
14_12.wav|They also added this weird texture for the first time to this plastic back that, you know, made it a little softer, yes, but also totally made it look like a band-aid.|1
14_13.wav|Plus it even came in this flesh color that also didn't stick around long.|1
14_14.wav|They also added a fingerprint reader to the home button.|1
14_15.wav|Fun fact, back in these days, you actually had to swipe your whole finger across the home button to get it read.|1
14_16.wav|Of course, fingerprint readers have stuck around, but it doesn't have to be swiped anymore.|1
14_18.wav|And you can see this weird port at the bottom here.|1
14_19.wav|The Galaxy S5 has a sort of a double port.|1
14_20.wav|Basically, it could be used as just normal micro USB for charging.|1
14_21.wav|But if you wanted full USB 3.0 data speeds, there was a special like double-ended cable you could plug in to use all the pins and get that.|1
14_22.wav|Kind of weird that didn't stick around long either.|1
14_23.wav|Also, there was a flap on the bottom of all of these phones for water resistance and they were super easy to fall off.|1
14_25.wav|Naturally, they also released both an active and a separate sport version of this phone alongside the regular Galaxy S5.|1
14_27.wav|So Samsung Galaxy S6 came out in 2015.|1
14_28.wav|But truthfully, this was the beginning of a new era for Samsung phones.|1
14_30.wav|This is when they entered the modern age, for better or for worse.|1
14_31.wav|So this phone was the first one with a fully glass back instead of plastic, which yes, made it their first non-removable back.|1
14_33.wav|And this phone is sleek, like footprint wise, it's literally the same size as an iPhone 15 Pro from today, but turn it sideways and it's one of the slimmest phones ever, thanks to having a 25, 50 milliamp hour battery.|1
14_36.wav|Now this is a recipe to make enthusiasts particularly mad.|1
14_38.wav|So they heard that this went from a 2,800 to|1
21_0.wav|And Samsung drops Galaxy S21.|1
21_1.wav|Definitely bringing us up to the current design language that is so recognizable as a Samsung phone.|1
21_2.wav|So this triple camera is now on the corner of the back.|1
21_4.wav|In fact, this might be their best one with the metal piece melting over the sides and specifically this purple and gold colorway.|1
21_6.wav|This is also the beginning of the base models being extremely boring.|1
21_7.wav|I'm calling it now, like the action's way higher and lower in the lineup, like the note fighting the ultra for supremacy, that's crazy.|1
21_8.wav|Also the fan edition and the A-series kind of fighting each other to be the best overall value, but sitting in the middle, kind of a no man's land that just can't mess anything up and has to play it safe.|1
21_10.wav|They actually bumped down to a 1080p display.|1
21_11.wav|They're back to flat displays now.|1
21_12.wav|No more expandable storage in this model.|1
21_13.wav|No more charger in the box for this model.|1
21_14.wav|Whatever the industry's doing, that's what they're doing.|1
21_16.wav|There's just enough brand cache that like if they make a Samsung version of the phone that everyone's buying in stores and put it next to that in the store,|1
21_18.wav|So Galaxy S22 is more along the same track, slightly more boring colors, slightly flatter edges all the way around.|1
21_19.wav|But on the upside, this thing also does basically have perfectly thin bezels all the way around at this point.|1
21_20.wav|So I think the screen to body ratio now is well into the nineties.|1
21_21.wav|And frankly, I don't even care what the number is anymore.|1
21_22.wav|I just feel like there's so little bezel to hold with my fingers that anything less wouldn't really make any sense.|1
21_25.wav|But now that we have the tech to go right up to the edges and the corners,|1
21_27.wav|It just looks sick and is flatter and is more durable.|1
21_28.wav|So actually maybe the most notable change on the outside here is these phones are now slightly smaller than the previous year.|1
21_29.wav|So it went from 6.2 and 6.7 inches to 6.1 and 6.6 inches for S22 and S22+.|1
21_30.wav|And there is no doubt in my mind that that is specifically to give more room and a bigger gap to the Ultra phone at the top of the lineup.|1
21_31.wav|The Ultra has been doing battle with the Note.|1
21_34.wav|And so with these boring default base phones for 750 bucks, flat, totally fine.|1
21_38.wav|So the Galaxy S23 was interesting for one reason and one reason only, no more Exynos version.|1
21_39.wav|So every single Galaxy S23 and Galaxy S23 Plus and S23 Ultra ships with the same slightly customized Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset.|1
53_0.wav|You like the best that should reveal the best actual smartphone camera So that's exactly what we did this year.|1
53_1.wav|We took these 20 smartphones Updated all of their software charged them all up got their batteries to 100%|1
53_2.wav|Then we went out and took the same three photos with each one.|1
53_3.wav|One daytime photo, one low-light photo, and one portrait mode photo.|1
53_4.wav|Yes, it is surprisingly hard to stay perfectly still for 20 identical photos to be taken in a row, but I did it for you.|1
53_6.wav|That should give us a statistically significant winner and loser.|1
53_8.wav|And the results this year were kind of interesting, a little bit.|1
53_9.wav|I almost didn't make this video, but I can tell people have been waiting.|1
53_10.wav|The competitive tension is high and the actual results might be a little surprising to some of you.|1
53_12.wav|So the data our site spits out all comes in these text files with matchup ratings for every single combination of smartphones.|1
53_13.wav|We actually had them coded by letters of the alphabet you can see, A through T. But that little number, that one right here, is the most important.|1
53_14.wav|That is the ELO rating.|1
53_15.wav|You know, the system that ranks chess players or tennis players, basically anything head-to-head.|1
53_16.wav|With enough matchup information, we can sort of sort through all of these letters based on who they beat and who they lose to and create a power rankings and that will give us our winners.|1
53_17.wav|So the question you probably all want to know, who were the winners?|1
53_18.wav|And so we'll go, we'll go category by category because like I said, there were three different scenarios, daytime, low light, and portrait mode.|1
53_21.wav|For the regular daylight photos, we kind of had it set up with just me sitting in front of this window here, but there's a lot to this photo.|1
53_22.wav|The strongest light is from inside the room, but then the window light is actually a good test of dynamic range.|1
53_25.wav|There's the orange chair next to the blue pillow, a few other things.|1
53_27.wav|There's no individual variable that can dominate this test.|1
53_28.wav|So every single phone, we try to frame the exact same way from the exact same spot, holding one of them up as a reference so we can get as close as possible.|1
53_30.wav|We just open the camera app, make sure the lens is clean and just hit the shutter button.|1
53_31.wav|We don't even tap to focus, just point and shoot.|1
53_32.wav|It takes about six minutes to go through all 20 phones.|1
53_33.wav|Like I said, it's kind of hard to sit still for six minutes straight, but we did it.|1
53_34.wav|So for this regular daylight photo situation, the winner with the highest ELO rating is the Pixel 7a.|1
53_36.wav|So this is the photo that you guys, for the most part, voted as the winner in most of its matchups.|1
53_37.wav|pretty neutral photo to be honest, not too bright, not too dark, pretty excellent dynamic range.|1
53_38.wav|And it's also not a fluke because the second highest ELO rating came from the|1
93_0.wav|like pixel peeping detail, but over a longer distance, over a bunch of generations, that's the type of thing that adds up.|1
93_1.wav|They even on the pro phones did a couple of presets from the 1X lens.|1
93_4.wav|Honestly, the most pro things about these new phones though is definitely their video cameras.|1
93_5.wav|So I'm just gonna nerd out about these for a second.|1
93_6.wav|Because the iPhone's video capabilities|1
93_7.wav|I've talked about this so much, but there are still so clearly far out in front of the rest of the smartphone world.|1
93_8.wav|It doesn't even shoot 8K, which it's totally capable of with the 48 megapixels.|1
93_10.wav|But even just that 4K 30 in full auto, the detail, the auto-focus, the slight depth, the dynamic range, the stabilization, they're all world-class.|1
93_11.wav|I mean, if you wanna just look at test footage,|1
93_12.wav|The entire electric Rivian delivery van review I did on the autofocus channel was shot on iPhone 15 Pro, audio included.|1
93_13.wav|I'll drop the link below if you want to watch that whole thing.|1
93_14.wav|Also shout out to the new AV1 codec support on the chip.|1
93_16.wav|But this year you can also shoot log, literally a pro camera feature.|1
93_17.wav|Now, it is annoyingly buried several layers deep in the separate settings app, which is really not very pro.|1
93_18.wav|But if you find the time to go switch over there and get into log, the iPhone will shoot with way more information, that classic flat log look, dynamic range, everything.|1
93_19.wav|And you don't have to deal with whatever Apple was going to do with oversharpening and saturation and processing.|1
93_20.wav|Apple has its own transformation LUT to turn it into SDR or HDR, or you can go in and fully grade it yourself to really get the most out of the iPhone's video.|1
93_21.wav|And it looks really, like really, really good.|1
93_22.wav|So the one thing that I'm going to say to, you know, because I'm pixel peeping at this point is the haloing from point light sources.|1
93_23.wav|It's one of the hardest challenges with these tiny optics, so I get why they haven't just fixed it yet, but it's pretty bad.|1
93_24.wav|Anytime there's any sort of point lights, especially with video, despite whatever new lens coating they're doing, it's pretty dramatic and it seems like it's the worst on the iPhone of any other phone.|1
93_25.wav|So it's there, gonna point it out again, but hey, if that's the biggest downside of iPhone video, I'll definitely take it.|1
93_26.wav|And then iPhone 15 Pro Max, the big one, is the only one that comes with the new 5X larger telephoto lens.|1
93_27.wav|I would bet my life that that's going to come down to the smaller 16 Pro next year, whatever, but it's only in the big one this time.|1
93_28.wav|But yeah, it does let you get a little further with max zoom from 15x to 25x.|1
69_2.wav|They talk about this fancy new anodization process for the aluminum.|1
69_4.wav|It's an actual new chemistry process that is a part of the anodization itself.|1
69_5.wav|It's supposed to be extra fingerprint resistant.|1
69_6.wav|But now that we actually have it here, in reality, it's, I mean, it's darker, but like, it's, it's,|1
69_7.wav|It's just a little bit darker than the other space gray from before.|1
69_8.wav|If you wanna see a black laptop, this is a black laptop.|1
69_9.wav|Like they make black laptops already.|1
69_10.wav|So Apple's here is just, it's a darker gray.|1
69_11.wav|I think it's basically the darkest that Apple could get without showing a ton of fingerprints.|1
69_12.wav|I mean, it still does show some fingerprints a little bit.|1
69_14.wav|But compared to some other black laptops I've tried, it is better than those.|1
69_15.wav|So it's somewhere in the middle of not so many fingerprints, but also darker than normal.|1
69_18.wav|Like some camera angles it hits, it really looks dark, but.|1
69_20.wav|It also, if you're curious, it also comes with black Apple stickers, and it also comes with a black MagSafe charging cable.|1
69_21.wav|But also that braided cable is darker than the end, and it also comes with a brick that's still white.|1
69_22.wav|So I wouldn't say they've fully committed to the space black theme quite yet.|1
69_24.wav|But then let's talk about the chip inside.|1
69_25.wav|So the new three nanometer M3 family of chips gets announced and it does offer some nice improvements over the M2 family, definitely.|1
69_26.wav|It almost feels weird to compare it to the M2 stuff because almost nobody with an M2 should be upgrading to this, but at least it's a good frame of reference.|1
69_27.wav|So I've been testing the absolute highest end M3 Max in this laptop, which from the M2 Max goes from a 38 core GPU to a 40 core GPU.|1
69_28.wav|and from 96 gigs of shared memory to now up to 128 gigs.|1
69_29.wav|CPU wise, Apple's claims were about right.|1
69_30.wav|You know, somewhere in the 20, sometimes 30% improvement range over last year, which is very respectable.|1
69_31.wav|And actually it's a bigger jump in single core performance than I was expecting, which is awesome for, you know, just the daily use, the quick snappy, everyday computing browsing type stuff.|1
69_32.wav|And then GPU wise, this is where more people were hoping for a little bit of a bigger improvement.|1
69_33.wav|And again, it is a respectable bump.|1
69_36.wav|And for a laptop like this, that's typically games or high powered graphics related applications.|1
69_37.wav|So yeah, when you see that powerful new GPU in a laptop,|1
135_2.wav|I just have this thought of like, you're on an airplane and the flight attendant walks up and taps you, hey, do you want any water?|1
135_3.wav|And you just look up and your eyes shine through the headset.|1
135_5.wav|I don't think, it's smart, but I don't think other headsets are gonna do it because most of them don't have it in the budget to have a screen facing the outside.|1
135_6.wav|But then let's get to the burning question you've probably already been thinking, what does it actually do?|1
135_7.wav|So, okay, I'm separating this into three bulk categories that I made up and I'm kind of proud of here, which are computing, content, and connections.|1
135_8.wav|Now, actually, I should preface this all by saying this is a first gen product.|1
135_9.wav|So right now the only apps that show up on the home screen are Apple's apps.|1
135_10.wav|Just like when the first iPhone came out with no app store, it's just Apple's apps.|1
135_12.wav|So for computing, I think this is the one that's probably the least likely to be used by most normal people, but it is a pretty direct shot at what Meta just did with the Quest Pro, the $1,500 Quest Pro.|1
135_13.wav|So you can use this thing as its own computer with web browsing, et cetera, with these 4K windows in front of you that you can move around and do all kinds of stuff with your hands.|1
135_15.wav|Again, it's not running off your phone or anything.|1
135_16.wav|It's running a whole new operating system called Vision OS.|1
135_18.wav|But I was really impressed with the responsiveness.|1
135_19.wav|Again, this was better than any headset I've seen with just your hands.|1
135_20.wav|If I wanted to scroll through something like a safari window, I literally in air would touch my fingers together and drag the window and it would scroll nearly in real time.|1
135_21.wav|I would like throw it around, like toss it, catch it, toss it the other way and start scrolling through things with my finger, resizing windows, dragging the corners of things.|1
135_23.wav|Now, if you're like me, you might have also had some questions about the sharpness.|1
135_24.wav|Like, do I really want to wear something like this for a long time to work like it's on a computer?|1
135_25.wav|And I think that was also pretty smartly addressed.|1
135_26.wav|They use a selective rendering based on the super good eye tracking.|1
135_27.wav|So the computing power is basically focusing on sharply rendering the part of the screen that you're actually looking at while saving power on the rest.|1
34_0.wav|is actually slightly less than the plastic MetaQuest Pro.|1
34_1.wav|But that Quest Pro also has a lot of battery on the back of your head as a sort of a counterbalance.|1
34_2.wav|So the weight distribution is very different.|1
34_3.wav|Also the Quest Pro is not that comfortable anyway.|1
34_7.wav|So this is the battery, as you saw in the unboxing.|1
34_8.wav|If you haven't already seen the unboxing, that just went up.|1
34_10.wav|But this battery is a surprisingly small 3,366 milliamp hours.|1
34_11.wav|I say surprisingly small because a normal battery bank of this size, you might expect to be 10, 15, 20,000 milliamp hours.|1
34_12.wav|I suspect there's a lot of heat insulation happening here, but it comes with a non-removable four foot cable and a proprietary connector at the end of the cable that will twist and lock to the headset.|1
34_14.wav|It makes sense that it's not just straight USB that could get disconnected easily.|1
34_15.wav|Once you connect it, it starts glowing and then it starts booting up.|1
34_16.wav|And there's even a little Apple logo that displays on the outside screen while it takes, you know, a little under a minute to turn on.|1
34_17.wav|So there is no on or off button or switch anywhere on this headset, maybe kind of like AirPods Max, something like that.|1
34_18.wav|So if you ever take the headset off and put it down, it will enter a standby mode after some time, but it won't turn off.|1
34_19.wav|If you want to turn it off, you literally have to|1
34_21.wav|That's the only way to actually turn the headset off.|1
34_22.wav|Now, famously already, the battery life with this included battery is not super long on this headset.|1
34_23.wav|Two to four hours is actually realistic for what you can expect for just like this built-in battery.|1
34_24.wav|But that's also kind of right in line with a lot of other VR headsets.|1
34_25.wav|Battery life on VR headsets is not that great in general.|1
34_26.wav|If you do want to use it longer, the only way to do that is there's a USB-C port on the battery and you have to plug the battery in.|1
34_27.wav|So you could plug the battery into the wall for infinite battery life, or I guess you could plug it into like a, you could daisy chain another battery into the other pocket or something for even longer life, but.|1
34_29.wav|Now at first, it seemed weird to me that the port is on the same side of the battery as the non-removable cable, but I think it's because they just want you to default to putting this battery like in your pocket, probably in your back pocket.|1
34_30.wav|So even if it's plugged into the wall, it can still be in your back pocket.|1
34_31.wav|You're just gonna wanna get a longer USB-C cable.|1
34_32.wav|So there are no controllers that come with this headset.|1
34_34.wav|So the first time you put on this headset, it goes through this calibration process.|1
40_0.wav|hit that arrow, and then there's this little icon to become my Mac's virtual display.|1
40_1.wav|So I click that, and then pick my Mac, and it pretty much instantly, it actually blacks out the display of my Mac, and then turns that display into a 4K window inside of the headset.|1
40_3.wav|And then the bonuses, you can still open up and place other Vision Pro apps around your Mac computer.|1
40_4.wav|So like you can have your Mac in the middle here and maybe you're editing or doing some work on the Mac app.|1
40_5.wav|And then you have a Safari window or messages or whatever else you want right next to it, around it.|1
40_6.wav|And then your keyboard and track pad can move seamlessly between them all to control all of them.|1
40_8.wav|Oh my God, I can't tell you how many times I've had an awkward conversation because like I'm editing a video on the plane, the person next to me sees I'm editing a video of myself and it's kind of weird and hard to explain, but...|1
40_9.wav|I'm picturing putting the headset on, the display blacks out, but now I can do all the editing I want and I can make the screen as big as I want.|1
40_11.wav|Again, the biggest challenge though is still remembering to look exactly at the thing you want to control.|1
40_12.wav|So aside from typing on the real keyboard on whatever windows open, if you want to control something,|1
40_14.wav|Again, it doesn't sound like a big deal, but when you try it, you'll see what I mean.|1
40_15.wav|And then also, odd limitation, one monitor only from the Mac, one virtual monitor only at a time.|1
40_16.wav|So if you usually run like a dual display setup like I do for Final Cut Pro, big preview on one side, timeline on the other side, you can't do that.|1
40_17.wav|You have to use the big one monitor version of your setup.|1
40_18.wav|All right, so you might've realized I've left one thing out this whole time.|1
40_19.wav|One thing, you could call it one more thing, sure.|1
40_20.wav|It's one more huge, crazy thing, but it's kind of the defining characteristic of this product, and that is personas.|1
40_22.wav|easily the most memed, most unique aspect of this headset, right?|1
40_23.wav|It's the only headset with an outward display.|1
40_24.wav|And I mean, it's very, very prominent in those videos.|1
40_25.wav|But in real life, as you've started to see from some of my footage, it is very different.|1
40_27.wav|So first of all, it's not actually see-through.|1
88_0.wav|Why would you get one of those when you could get a way more exciting Ferrari or McLaren instead?|1
88_1.wav|But as I've gotten older, I can appreciate the Porsche formula a little more.|1
88_3.wav|I wouldn't say I love it, but I can appreciate it more.|1
88_6.wav|This is the iPhone 15 Pro.|1
88_7.wav|Not a lot of changes.|1
88_8.wav|So, okay, I think people got to get this thought out of their head that you've got to upgrade every year to the newest phone.|1
88_9.wav|Like I realize most of us already know this, but for some reason people are still stuck on this thing where they say, oh, last year's phone is barely different from this year's phone.|1
88_12.wav|The Zenfone 10 I just reviewed is just a refinement of the Zenfone 9.|1
88_13.wav|Like the bleeding edge ROG phone has looked the same for three years now.|1
88_14.wav|The Pixel is finding its stride with design.|1
88_16.wav|to a bigger, more significant change.|1
88_17.wav|So that's what's happening here with this iPhone 15 Pro.|1
88_19.wav|They've made some improvements, but now we're starting to also see some possible problems, some new issues that have risen up.|1
88_22.wav|So there's basically four new features they've added here.|1
88_23.wav|I'm going to go over some of the more fundamental and existential stuff in the regular iPhone 15 review.|1
88_24.wav|So definitely make sure you're subscribed to see that when it comes out.|1
88_25.wav|But for the pro, it's time to deep dive on the stuff that's unique to this one, the professional stuff, that being the build, the chip,|1
88_26.wav|the cameras, and the action button.|1
88_27.wav|So easiest place to start is the way they've built this phone.|1
88_28.wav|So Apple made an update to the build and the materials of the iPhone this year.|1
88_29.wav|They've softened the corners a little bit.|1
88_30.wav|It's clearly still a boxy design, but you know, now instead of a completely flat glass at the front, there's this gentle little curve just at the very edges.|1
88_31.wav|I think that'll maybe make screen protectors slightly more intricate, but I think it has a nice look to it.|1
88_32.wav|And then the screen sizes are exactly the same, but now the bezels are actually a tiny bit slimmer all the way around.|1
88_33.wav|So technically the phone is like one millimeter smaller diagonally, and the rails have famously switched from that shiny stainless steel to a light|1
5_1.wav|If I was guessing, Zenfone 9 and Zenfone 10, despite how much we love them, didn't sell very well.|1
5_2.wav|And so they moved on kind of the same way that iPhone 12 mini and 13 mini didn't sell particularly well.|1
5_3.wav|The last part of that equation, the fun fact is even today, the most popular new iPhone is still the Pro and Pro Max, the super high-end biggest phone.|1
5_4.wav|And so what did Asus do?|1
5_8.wav|It's right in line with the|1
5_9.wav|The Enthusiast Phone Dilemma|1
52_0.wav|picked up from my tone and from the rest of the specs in this video, this is not a six, $700 phone.|1
52_1.wav|This is a very flagship phone with a very flagship price.|1
52_2.wav|This ROG phone starts at $1,100.|1
52_3.wav|And the spec that I'm reviewing with the 24 gigs of RAM and the terabyte of storage, this ROG phone pro is $1,500.|1
52_4.wav|Now, I also want to point out that you're going to start noticing AI features with basically every phone that comes out this year with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.|1
52_6.wav|There's maybe one or two other Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 phones out, but Qualcomm has built in new AI capabilities into that chip.|1
52_8.wav|Every manufacturer's got some new AI stuff to play with in their phone.|1
52_10.wav|Now I found the, you know, the smaller stuff like the setting search more useful.|1
52_12.wav|It can intelligently find the setting you're looking for based on what you write.|1
52_13.wav|So even if you type like two of one, it knows, oh, you're talking about the twin apps feature that lets you have multiple accounts open for one app at the same time.|1
52_14.wav|But in general, that's just going to be a theme of 2024 to look out for.|1
52_15.wav|AI capabilities of phones with this chip.|1
52_16.wav|Just, you can just trust me on this one.|1
52_17.wav|So the summary of the ROG phone is, look, this is a very, still a very capable, powerful, really fast Android phone, like it always is.|1
52_18.wav|And it's just a little more tame looking.|1
52_19.wav|Like they've traded some of their gamery edge for mass appeal.|1
52_20.wav|And I think a lot of the decisions were really smart.|1
52_21.wav|Like trading some of the basic stuff like thinner bezels|1
61_0.wav|If you open it, basically it just opens Google Assistant on your phone and then uses the mics and speakers on the watch for you to interact with it.|1
61_1.wav|The Find My Phone app is hilarious though.|1
61_2.wav|It only works when the CMF app is open or running on the phone.|1
61_3.wav|So if you've just closed the app, it will just ask you to open the app on your phone, but you don't have your phone.|1
61_4.wav|But when you do actually open it, so it plays this max volume ringing sound, which will allow you to find the phone, which is pretty cool.|1
61_5.wav|As long as you've got that app open or have opened it recently.|1
61_6.wav|And I will say the UI on the watch itself, it feels like it's moving around pretty quickly and not too much waiting time to actually open or switch between these apps.|1
61_8.wav|Like this thing is basically just a Bluetooth accessory, pinging little controls on your phone.|1
61_11.wav|I think this one's probably my favorite with the orange theme and a second hand moving slowly in a full circle down here.|1
61_14.wav|Not that people always value lightweight in watches, but in this price range, they're pretty much all gonna be made of plastic.|1
61_17.wav|So if you're doing sports or just running around, it's yeah, it's kind of out of the way.|1
61_18.wav|And then because it's a Bluetooth accessory and a pretty generic one, you can use this actually with basically any Android phone.|1
61_19.wav|So you just grab the Play Store app, which has a,|1
61_20.wav|3.1 stars, and it does have some connection issues occasionally for me, but even that sort of availability at least on any Android phone is better than Apple can say about their own smartwatch.|1
61_21.wav|And it gives me all the basic info I'm looking for from heart rate history to workout summaries.|1
61_23.wav|So, I'm also able to do sleep tracking since that only really requires the heart rate sensors, but I also continue to get that info from the sensors that are actually built into the mattress cover I use.|1
61_24.wav|At this point, I'm sure you've heard of Eight Sleep and the pod mattress cover that warms up and cools down each side of the bed independently, automatically.|1
61_25.wav|So that thing not only helps you sleep better by automatically changing the temperatures, but then it also monitors how you sleep.|1
61_26.wav|It's got the sensors inside and then delivers a report for you.|1
61_27.wav|So you just open the app every morning, you get this personalized report that shows you things like your heart rate variance, respiratory rate, you know, how your sleep stages panned out overnight.|1
61_28.wav|So I think I'm officially done wearing any wearables to sleep for any sleep tracking data just because this handles it all.|1
61_29.wav|Now I've actually talked about them before and I saw a lot of your comments about 8Sleep and so I chatted with 8Sleep about them and was able to get them to offer a little bit more functionality to people who are new, like first time signing up.|1
61_30.wav|So they'll actually now, no matter what your membership level, they will give you a free sleep report every six months.|1
61_33.wav|I'm happy to report that they're also offering you guys the largest discount that they ever have.|1
61_34.wav|So if you want to check it out, feel free to check out the link in the description and use code MKC.|1
61_35.wav|So now that I'm not wearing it to sleep, I am able to charge the CMF watch every night.|1
61_36.wav|Like I said, it's got this little magnetic pin charger.|1
61_37.wav|Technically not as pretty as those fancy wireless charging pucks, but honestly pretty close.|1
83_2.wav|Theoretically, that's going to be one of the things that you'll have to pay the 300 extra dollars to get up to the pro phone for, but also someone's already ported it to the Pixel 6.|1
83_3.wav|So like, come on Google, you ain't slick.|1
83_4.wav|There's even a blog post about some other features that are coming to the Pixel.|1
83_5.wav|They have this thing called Zoom Enhance.|1
83_6.wav|That's basically a generative fill version of Super Res Zoom.|1
83_7.wav|That's coming later this year only to Pixel 8 Pro for some reason.|1
83_8.wav|and a specially improved Magic Eraser version that uses generative fill on the 8 Pro and only the 8 Pro.|1
83_12.wav|I hope the world can see now what's really going on out here because it's getting ridiculous.|1
83_15.wav|Magic Editor is...|1
83_17.wav|It's one of the wildest things they've ever made.|1
83_18.wav|It is available on both phones, and it definitely goes beyond fixing it in post.|1
83_19.wav|So you open up a photo, you hit edit, and then at the bottom left corner, there's this wonderful, colorful, rainbow magic editor button just tempting you to press it.|1
83_20.wav|From here, the editor UI is basically saying, all right, go ahead and select something with your hands and then we can change it.|1
83_22.wav|Select an object and you can remove it, move it around, resize it, select a person, we can move them up or down, or|1
83_23.wav|hit the bottom middle button to switch the whole scene to golden hour or replace the entire sky in your photo.|1
83_24.wav|And then once you submit the edit, it takes a few seconds to process and then kind of like Dali, it gives you four options of this edit to pick whichever version is the most convincing.|1
83_25.wav|They're not professional photographer level edits, meaning you can zoom in and pixel peep and find some edges sometimes that look weird here or there.|1
83_26.wav|I also did try the exact same generative fill example that they showed in their commercials of this kid on a park bench where it oppressively fills in the missing balloons.|1
83_27.wav|When I do it, it kind of tries to do that, but definitely doesn't do it nearly as well.|1
83_28.wav|But the truth is, zoomed all the way out, these are decently convincing edits to regular people.|1
83_29.wav|And you can just do it with any photo in your library.|1
83_31.wav|Now, every once in a while, I did get a pop-up box over my edit attempt that said, it's unable to show results because it might violate our Gen AI terms.|1
83_32.wav|But I was never able to find like exactly why or any trend in this.|1
83_33.wav|It seemed to come up more often when I tried to edit a picture of a person, but then it would totally let me just select a watermark in a photo and effortlessly delete that, which is,|1
83_34.wav|probably gonna be a concern for some photographers.|1
83_35.wav|So yeah, I would just say, I'm probably gonna end up making an entire separate video just about this tool, cause it's fascinating and what it brings into the world.|1
79_1.wav|So it's pretty fluid and you don't have to rely on saying certain specific phrases to get it to keep going through the conversation.|1
79_2.wav|Now, you know, it's not the best AI assistant I've ever heard and it still has its limitations.|1
79_3.wav|It still can't set alarms or access third-party services that aren't meta.|1
79_4.wav|But the fact that I could be on a phone call right now and you wouldn't even notice in public|1
79_6.wav|There's two different styles by Ray-Ban for these.|1
79_7.wav|These are the Headliner and the Wayfarer.|1
79_8.wav|The downside is very clearly battery life.|1
79_9.wav|I mean, this is a small, small battery to fit in here.|1
79_10.wav|So it's cool that you have this wireless charging case.|1
79_11.wav|So the second you take them off, you can just put them in the case and charge them back up, just like earbuds, basically.|1
79_12.wav|So it's more about how many times the case can charge them up.|1
79_13.wav|Honestly, on one charge, if I listen to a bunch of music and take a bunch of pictures and videos, I can kill these things in under two hours.|1
79_14.wav|But they're quoting 36 total hours of battery life with the charging case.|1
79_15.wav|By the way, the recording light is on one side, but then it's the camera on the other side.|1
79_16.wav|So that keeps it nice and symmetrical, like normal glasses should be.|1
79_18.wav|This is about as much tech as you can fit in a normal looking pair of glasses in 2023 without it starting to look weird with the current tech we have.|1
79_19.wav|But it's gonna be more and more and more stuff and still looking like this every year.|1
79_21.wav|Which side would you bet gets mass adoption first?|1
79_22.wav|And this is a question tech companies have to answer before they start investing.|1
79_23.wav|Now, Meta is invested in both, so maybe they win either way and they're involved.|1
79_24.wav|But if you're Snapchat, they've already tried just the smart glasses and maybe they'll keep doing that later.|1
79_25.wav|If you're Apple, they've clearly started with Apple Vision Pro and they're gonna try to miniaturize that and shrink that year after year.|1
79_27.wav|And what a time to be alive for all of this.|1
79_28.wav|Because the tech that we're gonna have on our faces in 10, 20 years is gonna look insane compared to what we have today.|1
79_29.wav|The same way that the tech we had 10 years ago looks archaic compared to what we have now.|1
79_31.wav|One, Quest 3 for 500 bucks is awesome.|1
79_32.wav|And if you're looking to get a VR headset or a mixed reality headset at all, no problem recommending this one.|1
79_34.wav|Two, Apple's Vision Pro is still on track to be released early.|1
63_1.wav|Mainly that there are no reflections at all.|1
63_4.wav|So this phone is called the Next Paper because it has what TCL is calling a full color electronic paper display to deliver a reflection free|1
63_5.wav|full color paper-like visual experience, which looks way better, has much less fatigue on the eyes, and also feels better in the hand.|1
63_6.wav|And so my first thought when I first saw this was, okay, why doesn't every phone have this?|1
63_7.wav|Like how is it a super cheap budget phone that's the first one I've seen to pull this off, and why aren't more phones doing this?|1
63_9.wav|And so of course I had to use it to get all of these answers.|1
63_10.wav|So, okay, TCL calls it the next paper because they'd like you to think of it as just like an e-paper display.|1
63_11.wav|If you've ever seen a Kindle or any of the other various e-ink displays out there, that tech is actually kind of sick.|1
63_13.wav|It minimizes fatigue on the eyes and it looks and feels like something's literally printed on a piece of paper, like a newspaper in front of you.|1
63_14.wav|It works great in all sorts of different lighting because it's literally rearranging actual ink underneath the display.|1
63_15.wav|But this is actually not that.|1
63_16.wav|Instead, it's an LCD display with a textured glass on top and some software tricks to resemble a paper-like display and deliver almost all of the eye comfort benefits that come with it.|1
63_18.wav|is basically what looks like a normal smartphone screen with zero reflections.|1
63_19.wav|And I am very into that.|1
63_20.wav|Like look at this screen next to a glossy, regular smartphone glass screen.|1
63_21.wav|Typically when I review phones, like I have to spend a lot of effort shielding these displays from reflections.|1
63_24.wav|When you shoot reflective things, it is a challenge.|1
63_27.wav|But with this matte display, I mean, I just don't need any of that special treatment.|1
63_28.wav|Like it's happy to show up at any angle.|1
63_29.wav|And the angles that would normally have a giant reflection, it just kind of looks a little bit lighter, a little faded, but still actually readable.|1
63_30.wav|And then when you're straight on or just kind of regularly reading, it's nice and soft and it's less stressful on the eyes.|1
63_31.wav|It is kind of weirdly a little bit paper-like, like some of those paper-like displays.|1
63_32.wav|So almost all of this is enabled by|1
63_33.wav|Hardware, so there are a bunch of extra layers between the actual LCD display and you including this textured glass.|1
63_34.wav|And so that's all what gives it this anti-reflective look.|1
63_35.wav|There's also some other benefits like physically limiting the amount of blue light that makes it through.|1
63_36.wav|So instead of a special mode in the software there is just physically less blue light making it through an additional filter into your eyes.|1
63_37.wav|And another underrated one, the feel.|1
63_38.wav|I mean, literally the way the glass feels under your finger.|1
43_0.wav|I think if you have a darker skin tone like me, just don't expect the eyes to show up very brightly on the outside of the headset.|1
43_2.wav|Even when it does show up, it's a little weird looking.|1
43_3.wav|The eyes are a little too far apart sometimes.|1
43_6.wav|It's kind of weird, but that persona though, that is some pretty interesting stuff.|1
43_7.wav|It's crazy that this is actually a real thing being shipped, like first Meta started doing it, now Apple's doing this.|1
43_8.wav|This is, again, it's technically in beta, so.|1
43_9.wav|I don't know, there's room for improvement, but it still works.|1
43_10.wav|But as of right now, I feel like this is both incredibly impressive and slightly unsettling.|1
43_12.wav|But at the same time, it's just,|1
43_14.wav|It's right at the edge of the uncanny valley of, I'm not looking at a person.|1
43_15.wav|So, yeah.|1
43_16.wav|But the crazy part is, you can now use this persona as your camera feed for any apps in Vision Pro that require a front-facing camera, like FaceTime.|1
43_17.wav|And so I've tried, I've been using FaceTime a few times in the Vision Pro, and it is technically speaking,|1
43_19.wav|So I've made a few FaceTime calls in the past few days with some fellow reviewers who you'll probably recognize from their personas who are also testing the Vision Pro.|1
43_20.wav|And universally, once we all got past the shock of, oh my God, it's you, it looks like a digital version of you, this is crazy, I've never seen anything like this before.|1
43_23.wav|So you can see the FaceTime windows literally appear as just that.|1
43_24.wav|They're just like glassy windows floating in space with people looking through them.|1
43_25.wav|And then the angle that you look into the window is gonna match the angle that they see you looking at them.|1
43_26.wav|Meaning if we're all Envision pros on this call,|1
43_28.wav|If we're all Envision pros and you've got a bunch of people on this FaceTime call, so there's somebody to the left and somebody to the right.|1
43_29.wav|If I look to the person and make eye contact with the person to the right, the person to the left sees like the side of my head because I'm looking at somebody else.|1
43_31.wav|And then the same thing is true for hand gestures.|1
43_33.wav|Turns out you can reach out and make hand gestures that are tracked by the cameras in this bubble in front of you.|1
43_34.wav|And they show up at the correct angle towards the person that you're gesturing at.|1
43_35.wav|So not towards everybody else on the call.|1
43_41.wav|Now wait, so now Brian, do you see this?|1
15_0.wav|to a 2,500 milliamp battery, and it's not removable anymore.|1
15_1.wav|And it also no longer has the micro SD card for expansion of your storage.|1
15_2.wav|And on top of that, you also went from that weird USB 3.0 thing down technically to USB 2.0.|1
15_3.wav|But aside from that, this still did feel like their first really modern piece of hardware.|1
15_4.wav|This is also the first time we're getting a 1440p|1
15_6.wav|It's crazy sharp already.|1
15_7.wav|We haven't seen a higher resolution since then.|1
15_8.wav|And it's also the first Galaxy S flagship with optical image stabilization in the primary camera.|1
15_9.wav|So this is a really big camera upgrade and it was the first Galaxy S flagship to use 64 bit processing.|1
15_10.wav|I do remember there was a lot of positive reception around this phone, obviously from being well put together and metal and glass now and having good features and just generally being the same price as the previous year.|1
15_11.wav|I just feel like there was one thing holding it back, especially among us critical reviewers, from being the obvious best Android phone available at that time.|1
15_14.wav|See, around this time, there were also some other big enthusiast Android options, like Nexus 6P and 5X, which were stock Android.|1
15_15.wav|And then there was HTC One M9 just down the street with their own HTC software.|1
15_16.wav|LG G4 was out with their own software.|1
15_17.wav|And so like every Android device seen at this time, when it comes out, it's like, what are the specs?|1
15_20.wav|And then what is the Android skin that you have to deal with to get it?|1
15_21.wav|Now, TouchWiz has gotten better over time.|1
15_23.wav|It can slow down how quickly updates come to this phone over time, because they've got to go through Samsung, but it gives you a bunch of extra features in return.|1
15_24.wav|So at the time, if you go back, if you watch my videos around the phones at this time, I always preferred|1
15_25.wav|like stock Android, OEM, just straight from Google, it's always the fastest updates, and it just felt the cleanest and most coherent, where Samsung, TouchWiz just had this.|1
15_26.wav|this colorful cartoony look to it, this feel to it, it was a little cluttered, but it had the features, it had what mattered.|1
15_27.wav|Anyway, with S6, they also tried a little thing called the S6 Edge and Edge Plus, because there was this war being fought at the time.|1
15_28.wav|Every time you saw a keynote with a new smartphone announcement, they always mentioned|1
15_30.wav|And so every flagship, if they can improve the best number, they would always brag about the screen to body ratio, how thin their bezels are.|1
15_31.wav|And the best phones at the time were hovering around 70%, meaning 70% of the front of the device is screen.|1
15_32.wav|And the bigger that number, the cooler the phone looks.|1
15_33.wav|So this S6 Edge thing came along and it's another bit of Samsung innovation, just trying some stuff, but they literally bend the OLED display right over to the edges of the phone and use curved|1
136_0.wav|So quickly that I did not notice it while using it and then the part you're looking at is actually very sharp Like I said before they're super high resolution screens.|1
136_2.wav|And then for even more heavy work, this is kind of nuts, but they showed it in the keynote.|1
136_4.wav|And then you can even connect a Bluetooth keyboard and a Bluetooth trackpad and start working around like it's an actual Mac, just with a bigger screen wherever you want.|1
136_8.wav|But then of course there's the connection stuff.|1
136_9.wav|You got messaging, you can type out messages to people just like as if you were on a Mac.|1
136_10.wav|But there's also impressively FaceTime.|1
136_11.wav|Now I don't even know that this is necessarily better than a normal FaceTime holding your phone or like on a laptop, other than the fact that I guess you don't have to be holding anything.|1
136_12.wav|But you can have people's windows floating in front of you as you talk to them on FaceTime.|1
136_13.wav|But you might also be asking, wait a second, if I'm not holding my phone in front of me, what do other people on FaceTime see?|1
136_19.wav|So it's not as good as obviously looking at a person.|1
136_20.wav|I just feel like a FaceTime, you're trying to have like a personal connection with the person.|1
136_21.wav|And this is obviously more personal than an avatar or like a cartoon of you, but it's just, it feels kind of somewhere in between.|1
136_22.wav|It's kind of like a Google Project Starline, which I just did that video about a couple of weeks ago.|1
136_23.wav|If you haven't already seen that, I'll leave a link with a like button so you can check it out.|1
136_24.wav|But it feels sort of in that like uncanny valley,|1
136_25.wav|you know, moving 3D model territory instead of looking at an actual person.|1
136_27.wav|But then last but not least, of course, content.|1
136_28.wav|People are just going to watch content on this thing.|1
136_29.wav|And I think this is the industry, now that Apple is jumping into it, that is poised to explode.|1
136_30.wav|Like we've had VR games and VR videos for a long time.|1
136_31.wav|And Apple is now also able to do this.|1
136_33.wav|I can personally say from my demo, hell yes, I would watch, I would pay to watch an NBA game courtside in the VR headset.|1
136_34.wav|The quality is good enough, and obviously it's not going to be as immersive as|1
46_0.wav|Now this is all a theory, a lens theory, but I'm gonna have to test all this stuff out and of course see how well it works for the full review.|1
46_1.wav|So definitely make sure you get subscribed to see that when it comes out.|1
46_3.wav|Now, other than that, it feels like it's pretty much the same set of cameras across the board.|1
46_4.wav|And the Ultra, that also still has a 5,000 milliamp hour battery with the S Pen slotted in the side as usual.|1
46_5.wav|So if you want all the new specs across the board, here's a nice little chart we've made for you.|1
46_6.wav|So you can pause and see the numbers and the prices and everything.|1
46_7.wav|I do wish the S24 started at 256 gigs in 2024, but anyway, we got to talk about this new chip for a minute.|1
46_8.wav|So all of these phones are running the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip across the board.|1
46_9.wav|Great flagship chip, beginning of its life cycle.|1
46_10.wav|So, you know, there's a couple of phones trickling out with this one now, and there will be way more.|1
46_11.wav|And of course I have to test things like the performance and the battery life and how heating works out, but it's also very clear.|1
46_12.wav|that Qualcomm has built in a bunch of AI processing features into this chip.|1
46_13.wav|And so now it's up to the manufacturers who use the chip to decide what to do with it.|1
46_14.wav|And so there's phones coming out left and right with all kinds of AI features.|1
46_16.wav|are actually the most useful parts of some of these phones.|1
46_18.wav|So the big one that I think most people will find the most useful on this phone is the instant visual search.|1
46_19.wav|So no matter where you are on the phone, whatever you're doing, if you just hold down the home button, or if you have gestures, just hold down the gesture bar, you can then either tap or circle something on your screen to instantly Google search it.|1
46_20.wav|And it's just the few times I played with it, it's really fast.|1
46_21.wav|And this whole visual search feature thing|1
46_23.wav|Like we've had reverse image search and Google lens for years, but I'm loving the convenience of just, you know, being on a website, seeing an image or something you just want to know more about.|1
46_24.wav|And then just long pressing, Googling it real quick and getting the info or even something in your gallery.|1
46_25.wav|You know, maybe there's a landmark or something in a photo and you just Google the image.|1
46_27.wav|I think people are going to be probably using it a lot.|1
46_28.wav|It's also just something you have to spend a little time getting used to because everyone knows you can type things into Google, but to just visual search Google stuff.|1
46_30.wav|Then basically there's a bunch of other little places in the phone where you see the little stars, the little barred stars.|1
46_31.wav|If you see those, then you know there's some AI lurking ready to help you out.|1
46_33.wav|So the voice recorder app gets AI.|1
46_34.wav|So now it does much improved speaker labels and transcriptions, and it can actually summarize your voice recording after you record into a bunch of bullet points.|1
46_36.wav|Now it can do things like straighten out your handwriting or turn your notes into bullet points or summarize your notes.|1
46_37.wav|It's just, you got to find those little stars and press them.|1
46_38.wav|And the Galaxy S24 Ultra feels like it becomes more than just the ultimate note taking device, but now it's even more useful on top of the already borderline magical handwriting recognition and all that stuff.|1
46_40.wav|The phone app gets AI.|1
46_41.wav|So this stuff might start to sound familiar, but let's say you're going to have a phone call with|1
105_2.wav|It is, first of all, it's noticeably lighter in the hand, which I love.|1
105_3.wav|And it seems like it's also enabled them to shrink the body of the Pro iPhones just a little bit.|1
105_4.wav|So they have the same screen sizes, but the screens now get even closer to the edges and there's even thinner, slightly thinner bezels.|1
105_6.wav|Now, a lot of people are also quoting stronger as one of the benefits too, but I really don't think this is gonna make as much of a difference as people are thinking.|1
105_7.wav|Like the Pro iPhones have had this stainless steel rails for a while now.|1
105_10.wav|On the ground, I've dented the stainless steel rails.|1
105_14.wav|It's a glass that breaks.|1
105_15.wav|And as far as we can tell, it's the same ceramic shield glass on the iPhone 15 Pro.|1
105_17.wav|So if you drop it on the glass, you're still gonna have not great results.|1
105_18.wav|But yeah, technically, sure, titanium is stronger.|1
105_19.wav|Either way, the new colors are black, white, and this new blue, which is really subtle,|1
105_20.wav|And then natural, which I guess it kind of embraces the raw titanium feel, reminds me of starlight if you're curious, kind of like this warm tone.|1
105_22.wav|But also something else Apple said on stage, and this is pretty quick, so you might not have even picked it up, but they did mention that they have redesigned a bit of the interior of the chassis.|1
105_23.wav|to make the back glass more replaceable.|1
105_24.wav|So it's a more repairable iPhone design, technically.|1
105_26.wav|It's just one little step, but it's a step in the right direction for a more repairable iPhone.|1
105_28.wav|So it replaces the mute switch, which is pretty iconic, but it's in the same spot as the mute switch.|1
105_30.wav|So it's a pretty small button, basically about the same size as the switch.|1
105_31.wav|And by default, it actually behaves just like the mute switch did.|1
105_32.wav|So you actually hold it down to switch between muted or ringer on.|1
105_34.wav|But if you dive into the settings, there's actually a section for this action button.|1
105_35.wav|And it's actually really in depth and super solid.|1
105_36.wav|It basically lets you go through and pick the function of the button.|1
105_38.wav|So you can keep the mute switch on, or you can have it switch you in and out of a certain focus mode, like do not disturb, or you could pick whichever other one you want.|1
105_39.wav|You could also have it auto launch the camera and pick whichever camera mode it opens.|1
105_40.wav|You could also do flashlight turning on or opening up voice memos.|1
105_41.wav|or it can toggle the magnifier, or the last option actually is you can have it trigger a Siri shortcut, which as you know can technically do almost anything, including basically launching any app on your phone.|1
105_42.wav|I think there may be a bit of a delay|1
59_0.wav|So if you go to settings, and then camera, and then under formats, there's a new toggle to be able to record spatial video for the Apple Vision Pro.|1
59_1.wav|So things seem to be lining up, interestingly, for the Vision Pro to actually launch sometime in January or February, which should be pretty cool.|1
59_2.wav|And if you remember watching that one demo of spatial videos on the Vision Pro, yes, you can record them on the headset, which looks hilarious, but you can also record them|1
59_3.wav|on an iPhone, specifically only on an iPhone 15 or 15 Pro so far because of the horizontal alignment of the main and ultra wide cameras.|1
59_4.wav|So if you go into the camera app with that new check toggled in video, there's a little headset icon.|1
59_5.wav|And if I select that, I am now shooting that special spatial video, which means a few things.|1
59_6.wav|First of all, you must turn your iPhone sideways to landscape because your eyes are next to each other and not on top of each other.|1
59_7.wav|And it also will limit you to 1080p, 30 FPS, because it's actually processing two streams of video at once.|1
59_8.wav|One from the primary camera that you can see, but then the other one from the ultra wide camera for your other eye.|1
59_9.wav|So you can go crazy right now and just go out and start shooting a bunch of spatial videos on your iPhone.|1
59_10.wav|But if you go watch them on your phone, they will look just like normal videos because it's only gonna play back the video from the main camera.|1
59_11.wav|If you wanna see and appreciate the spatialness of the video, you will need|1
59_13.wav|Now, I've actually gotten to experience the Apple Vision Pro a few more times since that initial preview video that I did from Apple Park.|1
59_15.wav|But what I've actually gotten to do with it is shoot a bunch of my own spatial videos and then watch them back on the headset.|1
59_18.wav|It took me months to learn this, but if you ever have anything happening on the dynamic island, you can swipe across it to hide it, or change the view style.|1
59_19.wav|So clearly, you don't have to upgrade your phone every year, or every two years, or very often at all.|1
59_20.wav|But the more I use this phone, the 15 Pro, the more I'm confident that this is one of the good years to upgrade.|1
59_21.wav|From the updated cameras, to the USB type C, to the titanium, like there's the concept of an upgrade sweet spot, and I feel like this phone hit it, especially for people with much older iPhones.|1
29_0.wav|2700 mAh, and it can juice up at 80 watts wired.|1
29_3.wav|And then when you finally do get down to near zero, you can charge up to half battery in|1
29_5.wav|If you want to go all the way full, that's only going to take about half an hour.|1
29_7.wav|And on top of all of that, there is up to 50 watt wireless charging.|1
29_8.wav|So if you've got a compatible AirVOOC charger, you obviously have to buy that separately, but the OnePlus 11 didn't even have wireless charging at all.|1
29_10.wav|I almost want to get greedy and also wish that there was Qi 2 support for wireless charging, but|1
29_11.wav|I don't know about you, but Qi 2 has felt like it's off to a weird rocky start, especially this year.|1
29_12.wav|It's been surprisingly uncommon for any phones to support Qi 2 with the magnets and wireless charging.|1
29_13.wav|This is likely because there seems to be a 15 watt charging limit with Qi 2 for now.|1
29_14.wav|So if you wanna do fast wireless charging, you aren't doing Qi 2.|1
29_15.wav|So yeah, no Qi 2 wireless, no magnets, but very, very fast charging.|1
29_17.wav|Better chip, better battery, and also now the cameras have gotten an upgrade.|1
29_18.wav|Now, I'm just gonna say, cameras have been a relatively weak point for OnePlus's highest-end phones for a while now.|1
29_19.wav|We've always wanted to call them flagship killers, but people love cameras in flagship phones, and it just hasn't quite been able to match that highest level.|1
29_20.wav|I'd say now it's on the acceptable for a flagship level, but...|1
29_23.wav|Now, this main sensor, it is actually very slightly different.|1
29_24.wav|Instead of the OnePlus Open's Sony LYT-T808 sensor, it is the LYT-808 sensor.|1
29_26.wav|It's slightly wider aperture with the glass in front of it.|1
29_27.wav|Nevertheless, basically these OnePlus 12 photos aren't going to shock you.|1
29_30.wav|It's pretty good most of the time.|1
29_32.wav|It's a little contrastier than the OnePlus Open.|1
29_34.wav|It just, it falls apart a little too quickly as soon as there's adverse conditions, especially low light.|1
29_35.wav|But here's the thing, just for the context of that, it's not that far behind.|1
29_36.wav|We've already tested this because we did the blind smartphone camera test last year with 20 of the best smartphone cameras in the world.|1
119_0.wav|with satellite imagery and give you an initial quote.|1
119_1.wav|Then once you're locked in and you decide you want to go through with it, they'll actually come to your home with professionals and actually measure it and then give you a precise real quote and then start to order all the materials.|1
119_2.wav|You eventually get to the point where you get an install date, you start scheduling things out, and then they come through with all the boxes of solar panels and they took up my whole driveway for a couple days.|1
119_3.wav|There are people who have actually walked through this entire process in great detail.|1
119_4.wav|I'll try to link a good one below on YouTube, but|1
119_7.wav|But now that it's done, we get to nerd out about the numbers.|1
119_9.wav|I feel like that's really the only way to explain how good it is and what's happening with them.|1
119_10.wav|So there's about to be a lot of them.|1
119_13.wav|So this is a 29.313 kilowatt solar array size.|1
119_15.wav|And then there are three Powerwall 3s, which totals 40 and a half kilowatt hours.|1
119_16.wav|And then this is the Tesla app where all of the learnings and all of the numbers happen.|1
119_17.wav|When the system first got activated, I just remember like seeing it light up in the app for the first time, the numbers jump up and then just kind of, you just kind of get, I could stare at the app for a while.|1
119_19.wav|Maybe it's just because I'm a numbers person, but there's a lot going on and that's, it was exciting to see it all in real time and learn a lot of stuff.|1
119_20.wav|So I think the app is really well done and it lets you visualize how much energy the solar array is currently capturing|1
119_21.wav|how much energy the home is using, and the state of charge and power output or input of the power wall batteries.|1
119_22.wav|And then of course, anything happening with the electrical grid.|1
119_23.wav|So you can see at this exact moment in time on a sunny morning in July, the panels are bringing in seven kilowatts of power, five of which are powering the house.|1
119_24.wav|The last two of which are going into the power walls, which are 38% full and it's not touching the grid.|1
119_26.wav|There's already a lot of terms being thrown around here.|1
119_28.wav|Kilowatts is a measure of power, so one kilowatt is a thousand watts.|1
119_29.wav|A kilowatt hour, though, is a unit of energy collected.|1
119_30.wav|So a Tesla Model S battery, for example, is roughly 100 kilowatt hours.|1
119_31.wav|And so if that battery were to output 100 kilowatts for an hour, then it would be at zero.|1
119_32.wav|So for my setup, the Powerwall 3, each one is about 13 and a half kilowatt hours each.|1
119_33.wav|So that totals 40 and a half kilowatt hours since I have three and they support a maximum power output.|1
119_34.wav|in or out of 15.5 kilowatts.|1
119_35.wav|And then the solar system being 29.3 kilowatts means that basically it seems like the theoretical maximum of the electricity that can be collected|1
10_0.wav|Now, here's the thing, Samsung will try anything.|1
10_4.wav|They've had a Samsung Galaxy F series.|1
10_7.wav|Then there's the Galaxy Z series, Z for zero.|1
10_8.wav|And Galaxy M is, you'd think mid-range, but it actually stands for millennial.|1
10_9.wav|And then Galaxy A, that's some of the most popular affordable smartphones, so naturally it stands for alpha.|1
10_10.wav|There's Galaxy W for Wonder, Galaxy R for Royal, the list goes on.|1
10_11.wav|But then the flagship that's lived at the top of their lineup is the Samsung Galaxy S. And S stands for super smart.|1
10_13.wav|Anyway, the first ever Samsung Galaxy S comes out in 2010.|1
10_14.wav|Just to set the scene, this is three years after the first ever iPhones come out.|1
10_16.wav|This is a couple months after the Nexus 1 gets unveiled.|1
10_17.wav|Blackberry is quaking in their boots.|1
10_18.wav|The entire smartphone industry, if you want to call it that, is totally in a reshuffling.|1
10_21.wav|The second most popular phone selling by volume looks like this.|1
10_22.wav|It's a Nokia 3720 Classic.|1
10_23.wav|And so Samsung launches the first ever Galaxy S, super smart, into the world with over two dozen variations.|1
10_25.wav|You know, it was a pretty basic phone, big touchscreen on the front, some capacitive buttons, a plastic removable back, a single camera.|1
10_27.wav|So today I've got every single Samsung Galaxy S|1
10_28.wav|that has ever been released.|1
10_30.wav|Actually, it's every main Galaxy S variant from the S1 to the S24, everything in between, and I'm gonna review them all.|1
10_31.wav|And some of them I've reviewed before and others are like the first time I've ever gotten them working on camera, but either way, it'll be fun to go back and go through.|1
10_32.wav|This is the story of how we got to where we are today and where it started.|1
10_36.wav|Like usual, they're super fun.|1
10_37.wav|So, Samsung Galaxy S. This is the first one.|1
10_39.wav|And, yeah, it does clearly look old with the classic four capacitive buttons at the bottom, Android 2.1, and it's a micro USB port at the top next to the headphone jack.|1
10_40.wav|but I feel like right off the bat, you can see Samsung differentiating itself here.|1
10_41.wav|First of all, this is a reasonable display.|1
10_42.wav|This is a four inch screen and it's a Samsung made AMOLED display.|1
91_0.wav|and dogs and cats automatically and lets you go back in time and set a regular photo to a portrait mode photo.|1
91_1.wav|The USB 3 controller that enables faster data transfer speeds is also on the A17 Pro.|1
91_3.wav|But what I'm more concerned with at the moment is battery life.|1
91_4.wav|Okay, so actually it's kind of two main issues that have been popping up that you kind of have to try to figure out, are they isolated issues or are these real problems with the phone?|1
91_5.wav|And those are battery life and overheating issues.|1
91_6.wav|And to be honest, part of the reason this review took like longer than normal is I've been really trying to dig into the battery and figure out what's going on here.|1
91_7.wav|So objectively speaking, these phones have slightly bigger batteries than last year and a new three nanometer chip.|1
91_8.wav|So in a controlled environment, they should do better.|1
91_9.wav|And they do, they literally last longer on, like, simple benchmark stuff, so that's good news.|1
91_10.wav|Now, when I test a phone, like normal, I pretty much, I kind of go by feel.|1
91_11.wav|I always have some mix of good days, some average days, and then some bad days, where I can sort of figure out what's draining it, what its weaknesses are, and then I can come to a conclusion from that.|1
91_12.wav|So now here we are, I get a couple days in, I get a couple weeks in,|1
91_13.wav|And I've had a good amount of average days.|1
91_14.wav|I've had a couple of those bad draining days, but I also haven't had any of those amazing days where I get like nine hours of screen on time.|1
91_16.wav|And then we also started to see some of those headlines about battery life potentially being worse.|1
91_17.wav|And there's also some overheating issues popping up on Twitter or X. And some people were asking if mine has had any issues.|1
91_19.wav|Yes, but not what I would expect.|1
91_20.wav|I was, two days ago, literally I was just at a golf tournament.|1
91_21.wav|It was in Florida, it was like a hundred degree real feel or something crazy like that.|1
91_22.wav|And I'm outside with my phone at max brightness with GPS going all day out in the sun.|1
91_23.wav|And it was fine, no problem, no overheating issues.|1
91_24.wav|But then a couple hours later, I'm on the airplane with my phone in airplane mode.|1
91_25.wav|And I've got just like music playing on Bluetooth with Spotify and like scrolling through Instagram.|1
91_27.wav|for like five minutes, the phone just gets really hot and just blast through like 5% battery.|1
91_29.wav|And I'm like, there almost seems to be no rhyme or reason why it does this randomly once in a while.|1
91_30.wav|So my best theory is that the A17 Pro is just, it's a more powerful chip.|1
91_31.wav|And so therefore is able to drain power more quickly than before in high intensity settings like gaming, et cetera.|1
91_32.wav|And there's also been some issues attributed to iOS 17 bugs.|1
91_34.wav|I imagine there's some more updates coming to both iOS and a bunch of apps.|1
91_35.wav|But by the end of this, I kind of feel like I'm expecting battery life to basically even out to be the same as last year, which is a boring answer, but that's kind of what I expect.|1
91_36.wav|Now, we can talk all we want about what the word pro actually means in a smartphone, but with iPhones, that is mostly meant|1
91_37.wav|cameras and uh it turns out there is a lot going on with these relatively similar looking cameras on these new pro phones both in hardware and software.|1
134_2.wav|and it feels like telepathic.|1
134_3.wav|You just look at something and select it and that's it.|1
134_4.wav|So this is how the whole UI works.|1
134_5.wav|Pretty much every other headset has the ability to use your hands to select things, but most of them rely on the sensors on the outside to keep track of a set of controllers for maximum accuracy.|1
134_6.wav|But this massive array of sensors on the outside of Apple's headset have done an impressively good job of picking up what my hand is doing kind of no matter where it is.|1
134_8.wav|They're facing forward, but they're facing sideways and facing down.|1
134_9.wav|So I can just kind of rest my hand like wherever and look at stuff and click.|1
134_14.wav|Like I'd just sort of be sitting there and my fingertips would actually touch and I'd select whatever I was looking at.|1
134_15.wav|But pretty quickly you get used to just, just this, just, just doing this.|1
134_16.wav|Now there are also some text boxes occasionally you want to type something.|1
134_17.wav|And so you can look at the text box, select it, and then a keyboard will pop up and you can look at the letters, but also you can just look at a search box field and just start talking and it'll start filling in whatever you're saying.|1
134_19.wav|And there is also something they're calling Optic ID, which is basically kind of just the fingerprint ID of the headset because it's looking at your eyes and everyone's eyes is a different unique biometric pattern.|1
134_20.wav|And so you log in just by putting the headset on and it looks at your eyes.|1
134_21.wav|So Optic ID, this thing knows your eyes really well.|1
134_22.wav|So you've probably seen all these weird looking frames where you can see people's eyes through it.|1
134_23.wav|Like this super weird thing that I've never seen in any other headset.|1
134_25.wav|Well, spoiler alert, it's not actually transparent.|1
134_26.wav|It kind of looks like it's a glass transparent thing, but it's not.|1
134_27.wav|It appears to be because there's actually an OLED screen facing out.|1
134_28.wav|This is what I would call a two-way pass-through.|1
134_30.wav|See, a normal VR headset we've seen is of course completely opaque.|1
134_31.wav|Usually it's like black plastic or something like that.|1
134_32.wav|So in order to see through to your actual environment without taking the headset off, like for picking up your controllers or walking around a room without hitting a wall, they have a passthrough mode.|1
134_33.wav|So it'll turn on a camera on the outside so you can see what's going on around you.|1
134_35.wav|Some will do it from a single black and white camera.|1
134_36.wav|Some will do stereo passthrough from two cameras.|1
134_38.wav|The pass-through on Apple's headset is, again, the best I've ever seen in a headset.|1
134_39.wav|It's stereo, it's color, it's sharp, it's real-time, it's really good.|1
134_40.wav|So then the eyes you see from the outside are actually an OLED display showing what your eyes look like to the cameras inside the headset.|1
134_41.wav|So it shows your eyes like this whenever you're using any sort of pass-through|1
70_1.wav|But really, I think the reason, at least in my head, that most people don't associate gaming with Macs is not because they're not powerful.|1
70_2.wav|I mean, they're not as powerful as the highest end discrete GPUs, but they're not bad.|1
70_3.wav|It's just because the games that people play and are enthusiastic about are often not available on the Mac.|1
70_4.wav|Like I'm not even a big PC gamer, but you already know if you want to play The Witcher, The New Fallout, Skyrim, Crysis, Apex Legends, like there's a long list.|1
70_5.wav|And if you wanna throw maximum GPU power at that game to play it in the best possible quality, you're looking to optimize a PC, not buy a Mac.|1
70_6.wav|So I actually think, and I think it's maybe worth an entire separate video, maybe let me know if you're interested, but I think gaming on the Mac is in an all time interesting place right now.|1
70_7.wav|Because again, lots of games are not available on the Mac, but this is the most powerful Mac that's ever been made.|1
70_8.wav|And I've been playing with some of the games that Apple likes to show off, like in the app store, they're like, guys,|1
70_9.wav|We have games, there's lots of games and they're really good and they take advantage of the new stuff.|1
70_10.wav|I've been playing this game called Lies of P. It's one of the ones I talked about in the keynote and it takes advantage of the hardware accelerated ray tracing.|1
70_11.wav|You can see it in the reflections and on the floor and in the sword and everything.|1
70_12.wav|It plays amazing, like it looks great.|1
70_14.wav|I'm playing at 4K resolution.|1
70_15.wav|There's a visual depth and detail that's beautiful.|1
70_16.wav|Plus, Mac OS Sonoma has the gaming mode, which is allocating as much power as possible to this game.|1
70_17.wav|It also lets you use a Bluetooth controller with way faster sampling and lower latency.|1
70_18.wav|And so just maxing out everything works great.|1
70_21.wav|I just don't,|1
70_23.wav|Like I'm not invested in that particular game at all.|1
70_24.wav|It was fun to play the demo and I was impressed with the actual moment of the computing.|1
70_25.wav|It would get a little warm and the fans would spin up, but the fact that it would work on those max settings is amazing.|1
70_27.wav|And I think that sort of encapsulates the way I feel about all this extra GPU power is like, you could use it for gaming,|1
70_28.wav|But if you're gonna buy a computer for this much money to game, you're not buying a Mac.|1
70_29.wav|But then again, of course, this is a pro laptop.|1
70_31.wav|And so there are lots of other non-games that take advantage of this extra GPU power and of this new hardware accelerated ray tracing and the mesh shading and all that.|1
70_33.wav|And this laptop with this chip is better than ever at all that stuff too.|1
70_34.wav|And I think we're actually gonna slowly start seeing even more apps on the Mac take advantage of this stuff as time goes on.|1
70_36.wav|was okay look when the event happened i watched it and that last video you can see in that hotel room and i was very excited about it got announced i saw a new map|1
122_1.wav|So it was basically like a lot of days around zero and then every time I had to plug in the car to fill back up there would be a huge dent just a huge positive net use day on the calendar.|1
122_2.wav|So I actually had positive net grid usage months for all of November, December, and January.|1
122_3.wav|So I was pulling from the grid more than I produced solar all of those months.|1
122_5.wav|Things flip super fast.|1
122_6.wav|It turns out, if you were to guess which month I would generate the most solar or the most excess solar, what would you think?|1
122_7.wav|You'd probably guess like sometime in the peak of the summer with the longest day, June, July.|1
122_9.wav|In May, I used 6,500 kilowatt hours of electricity, but I generated nearly 8,500 kilowatt hours|1
122_11.wav|on total solar, that's cloud cover.|1
122_12.wav|So they didn't generate quite as much solar as May.|1
122_13.wav|We're just learning weather patterns out here through graphs of solar generation.|1
122_14.wav|This is also around the same month that I got the 8Sleep.|1
122_15.wav|So the 8Sleep is a pod cover that fits on a mattress like a fitted sheet, but it's temperature controlled so it can heat and cool each side of the bed independently|1
122_16.wav|They reached out around May to be a sponsor and I said yes, so that's when I installed it.|1
122_17.wav|I wouldn't say it replaced the need for air conditioning, it didn't, but it did actually legitimately decrease the total air conditioning you need when the bed is cooled off and the house doesn't have to be as cool.|1
122_18.wav|So it literally cools the bed before you get in, stays cool the whole night for optimal sleep, and then warms you up in the morning on autopilot every single day, which is sweet.|1
122_20.wav|Also, if you're curious, I talked about this on dope tech, but it's turned out to be pretty awesome.|1
122_21.wav|Obviously sleep is super important and temperature is like top of the list for sleep quality, falling asleep faster, waking up less.|1
122_22.wav|So investing in your sleep makes a ton of sense on top of maybe cutting into your AC use.|1
122_23.wav|So if you want to get a pod cover for yourself, you can actually use code MKBHD on their site and get $200 off.|1
122_24.wav|So I'll leave a link in the description and thanks again to Eight Sleep for sponsoring the video.|1
122_26.wav|I've had this solar setup for a full year now, all four seasons.|1
139_0.wav|where it's really gonna be up to the first gen, the early adopters, and the developers to decide the direction that this thing goes, to decide what people actually want to use it for.|1
139_1.wav|And that'll shape the future versions of it that we may eventually get down the road.|1
139_2.wav|Then maybe someday there's like a Vision SE that's like 400 bucks that the masses will all adopt and it'll be this next generation hit product, maybe.|1
139_3.wav|But as of right now, this is very much in the sort of early adopter, people like me, people like watching this video, testing phase, to figure it out.|1
139_5.wav|It's the rich person's toy and the developer's...|1
33_0.wav|that you have to understand in order to get a sense of what this headset actually is and what it does.|1
33_1.wav|So I'm gonna break this down into two parts.|1
33_2.wav|This video is all about using the Vision Pro.|1
33_3.wav|It's everything I've learned from the past week of wearing and getting used to this thing every single day.|1
33_4.wav|But I'm also working on a more wide ranging, possibly more existential review video.|1
33_5.wav|But let's just start with the more hardware fundamentals, right?|1
33_6.wav|Like, what is this thing that I'm holding, literally?|1
33_7.wav|Apple Vision Pro, at its core, well, it is a VR headset.|1
33_8.wav|Now, Apple would never say that, and they probably won't like that I'm saying that word.|1
33_9.wav|You know, I made an entire video about why they refuse to use those words, and they're calling it spatial computing instead.|1
33_11.wav|But the truth is, it's a really, really, really high-end virtual reality headset.|1
33_13.wav|It's got displays and lenses and speakers and fans and buttons.|1
33_15.wav|This is a thing that we have seen before.|1
33_16.wav|But before I even turn this thing on, there are clearly several things that are a little different about this one.|1
33_17.wav|So first of all, it's made of metal.|1
33_18.wav|Lots of metal and glass here, which are high quality, but,|1
33_19.wav|heavy materials, relatively speaking.|1
33_20.wav|So there's this precisely machined aluminum frame around the outside.|1
33_21.wav|And yes, those are intakes for fans at the bottom and then vents for those fans at the top.|1
33_22.wav|On the right side, there's your digital crown that can be pressed in or turned.|1
33_23.wav|And then on the other side is just a single larger button.|1
33_24.wav|So kind of basically the same two buttons as an Apple Watch.|1
33_25.wav|And then when you get a little further back on this band here, these little pods with downward facing grills, these are speakers which are pointed straight at your ears and work surprisingly well.|1
33_26.wav|Though, of course, it also means that people around you can hear a little bit of what you're hearing.|1
33_28.wav|And I have a lot to say about spatial audio, so stay tuned for that.|1
33_29.wav|But the main event is at the front.|1
33_30.wav|There is an enormous piece of glass, which yes, is very easy to fingerprint and smudge.|1
33_31.wav|And then behind that thing, there's this outward facing OLED display and a bunch of sensors all the way around, outside facing sensors that go forward, sideways, and straight down.|1
33_32.wav|And there's depth sensors, infrared illuminators, LiDAR scanners, and just regular old RGB cameras, all being processed by an M2 chip and an R1 chip|1
33_34.wav|And then maybe the craziest part, inside the headset, there are a bunch more sensors facing your eyes, tracking your eyes in real time for all the eye control and everything that comes with that.|1
33_35.wav|And also then to display a representation of your eyes on the outside of the headset.|1
31_0.wav|of that, like 12 or 16 gigs of fast RAM, that's sick, future-proof.|1
31_1.wav|Also, Dolby Atmos with spatial audio support, great.|1
31_2.wav|It also has great haptics, like all this tiny stuff adds up to be a great overall experience, but...|1
31_5.wav|No phone is perfect, but at least I can say about this phone that also the downsides are also a couple small things.|1
31_6.wav|Like I, for one, I've already talked about this, but I'm kind of over the curve displays.|1
31_7.wav|So this one keeping that, it's not a deal breaker.|1
31_8.wav|Like you might even argue it's a little more character to this phone in the world of 2024 smartphones, but.|1
31_9.wav|It definitely has its downsides, from the glare, to the light fall off, to the drop test durability.|1
31_11.wav|But then the fingerprint sensor underneath is also still a pretty average optical sensor.|1
31_12.wav|It doesn't feel like it's been upgraded in years.|1
31_13.wav|And then for having the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip inside, which a lot of other flagships do, this phone doesn't really have any of the AI features.|1
31_17.wav|kind of just skipped the AI part.|1
31_18.wav|Now, not that that's a disaster, but those were some genuinely useful features.|1
31_19.wav|The only one I found on this phone is in the photo editor and it's called AI Palettes, but it's just like a color overlay.|1
31_20.wav|I don't even really think there's that much AI going on with this at all.|1
31_25.wav|Every time I'm in the overlay browser and I reach up to my favorite little alert slider on the OnePlus phone and change modes, it opens a search box, like to find in page.|1
31_27.wav|They shouldn't be connected, but it does it every single time.|1
31_28.wav|But maybe the biggest legitimate downside of this phone when you're comparing it to the other flagships it's going up against is it's promised|1
31_29.wav|fewer years of software update support.|1
31_30.wav|Now I've already gotten a pretty major software update since I started testing this phone, big camera improvements and bug fixes and stuff like that, great.|1
31_31.wav|But they are only promising, only promising, four years of software updates and five years of security updates.|1
31_33.wav|Fine, a lot of people only plan on keeping this phone for 3 or 4 years, maybe 5 years before moving on to the next one.|1
31_34.wav|But in the world of the flagships, the Pixels, the Samsungs of the world, even the iPhones giving you 6 or 7 years of software updates, this is just notably behind on that.|1
31_35.wav|Maybe OnePlus didn't think it was worth the extra resources, it doesn't think people care that much about it to actually spend money on it.|1
74_0.wav|But then this huge camera module on the back kind of implies high-end cameras, but you can never really be sure until you test them.|1
74_1.wav|And sure enough, this Hasselblad camera setup is pretty decent.|1
74_2.wav|It's got this new stacked sensor for the primary sensor, a 3x telephoto, and an ultrawide.|1
74_4.wav|You basically have to switch to action mode, which there's a button for, and that works by cranking the shutter speed way up as expected, but then ISO starts to get a little high, high enough that photos are now a little noisier, a little worse looking.|1
74_6.wav|And by the way, this isn't one of the five pillars, but I also found that the microphone on this phone is actually quite good.|1
74_8.wav|I was pleasantly surprised, but it all comes together in a really nice phone that I think a lot of people, including myself, are going to really like using.|1
74_9.wav|So the question is, why do I think people aren't buying folding phones that much if they're this good?|1
74_10.wav|It turns out a phone can hit all five pillars of a great smartphone and not be a great buy for everyone necessarily.|1
74_12.wav|Number one is still price.|1
74_13.wav|Number two is the durability question.|1
74_14.wav|And then number three is just the power user problem.|1
74_16.wav|is $1,700 US.|1
74_17.wav|That is a lot of money to spend on a phone.|1
74_18.wav|No matter how you chop it up into monthly segments or staggered payments, it's just a lot, right?|1
74_19.wav|It's literally twice as much as an iPhone 15.|1
74_21.wav|That's literally right in line with its folding competitors.|1
74_22.wav|Like the other two folding phones available in the US, Pixel Fold, $1,800.|1
74_24.wav|So this one's actually kind of a bargain.|1
74_25.wav|That's the most obvious thing, holding these back, because they're still so expensive.|1
74_26.wav|But then number two, durability is also questionable at best.|1
74_27.wav|Now, of course, they do all the testing that they can.|1
74_29.wav|They've got IPX4 water resistance, which is nice.|1
74_30.wav|And they have a durability rating for a million folds of the hinge.|1
74_32.wav|But then what about these dead pixels that have started appearing at the bottom middle of my screen, right around the hinge?|1
74_33.wav|I've had this phone for three weeks and babied it, and this is already starting to show up on mine.|1
74_34.wav|It doesn't mean it's going to be bad for everyone, but that's not great.|1
74_35.wav|And I suspect it's not going to happen on non-folding phones.|1
74_36.wav|But the third and final reason folding phones, as great as they've been getting, aren't necessarily translating to mainstream success|1
74_37.wav|is that they're power user phones.|1
74_38.wav|They're folding and unfolding is a power user feature.|1
74_39.wav|And power user features, as much as we love them, don't sell a ton of phones.|1
74_40.wav|We figured this out many times when LG spent years and years making some of the most manually adjustable cameras in the smartphone world.|1
74_42.wav|And we still have Sony who can't stop making professional|1
3_2.wav|So like, I just reviewed every single Samsung Galaxy S ever.|1
3_3.wav|The year that they started to get really big, they of course also introduced a Galaxy S Mini.|1
3_8.wav|We finally got huge iPhones and then sure enough, we got an iPhone mini for two years, but now that's dead too.|1
3_9.wav|And this kept happening and happening all over the place until there was basically just one good, small flagship phone left.|1
3_10.wav|the Asus Zenfone, the rare breed.|1
3_11.wav|So this thing, the Zenfone 9 came out in 2022 and was a nearly perfect flagship phone.|1
3_12.wav|Like seriously, flagship specs, incredible performance, physics defying battery life, like rock solid cameras.|1
3_13.wav|This phone won my small phone of the year by a landslide, even with the few tiny flaws it had.|1
3_14.wav|You know, the back material being a little less durable and it didn't have wireless charging.|1
3_16.wav|They came out with a sequel, the Zenfone 10, and that took a good thing and basically perfected it.|1
3_19.wav|They upgraded it to the latest flagship chips.|1
3_22.wav|It was just the singular excellent flagship phone with a less than six inch screen in 2023.|1
3_23.wav|So now it's 2024 and the new Zenfone is a gigantic 6.8 inch ultra phone.|1
3_24.wav|Now, honestly, we probably should have seen this coming, right?|1
3_25.wav|When has a small flagship ever lasted more than a year or two, right?|1
3_26.wav|But it just, I don't know, it hits a little harder when this was the last small one.|1
3_27.wav|Like here's something to think about, right?|1
3_28.wav|I think Apple is, you could argue, one of the best supply chain companies in the world.|1
3_31.wav|That's how Tim Cook took the stock price from here to here.|1
3_34.wav|So every time they come out with a new product or a range of products, they have to do the supply chain thing and figure out exactly how many they need to produce.|1
3_35.wav|So they have these complex studies and their ways of estimating how many they think will be sold of every single SKU.|1
3_42.wav|So in 2020, for the first time, Apple decided to release a new lineup of four new iPhones.|1
3_43.wav|It was iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, the 12 Pro Max, and the 12 Mini.|1
3_44.wav|Of course, the 12 and the 12 Pro are the same size right in the middle, this nice little sweet spot of the lineup, and the 12 Pro Max just being this absolute maxed out, biggest screen, biggest price.|1
3_45.wav|But then the cheapest, most pocketable new iPhone in the lineup is this|1
64_0.wav|It kind of has this soft touch effect thanks to the slight texture.|1
64_1.wav|So you can actually see the difference up at the cutout at the top.|1
64_2.wav|You obviously can't do textured glass over the front facing camera because that would ruin the photos.|1
64_3.wav|Not that they're amazing photos in the first place, but that's the most obvious spot where you can see that difference between the matte finish and glossy glass.|1
64_4.wav|And my finger just runs over this glass almost the same way that it does on the back of the phone.|1
64_5.wav|So I think all this shaping up to be pretty cool.|1
64_6.wav|The matte finish, the basically zero reflections, the much lower eye strain, the soft touch finish.|1
64_7.wav|There's also stylus supports as TCL makes a stylus that actually works with this type of screen.|1
64_9.wav|Why don't more phones have this on them?|1
64_10.wav|and you're probably one step ahead of me already, which is, yeah, there are some downsides.|1
64_11.wav|So first of all, a bunch of extra layers on the display itself is gonna have some obvious drawbacks, but mainly it's just that they're cutting a lot of light.|1
64_12.wav|Like it hurts a lot of sharpness and just total light getting through to you.|1
64_13.wav|So this is the absolute maximum 100% brightness of this screen, and it's 450 nits.|1
64_14.wav|So it's good enough to read indoors as you've seen, but outdoors, it's gonna get pretty quickly washed out and is disappointingly dim.|1
64_16.wav|So I think if this was an even higher end phone with a brighter LCD or an OLED back there, maybe it could solve or help some of these issues, but that wouldn't fix.|1
64_18.wav|So this is a 1080p display, as I've said, but it doesn't even really look like that.|1
64_19.wav|I mean, I think if I asked you what resolution you think this is, or if I did a blind test or something, it would compare pretty closely to a 720p display.|1
64_20.wav|I mean, text is soft, edges of things are soft, all the|1
64_21.wav|corners are soft, it just all kind of has a little bit of a glow to the edges, which again, makes things nice and easy to look at, like nothing as harsh or super bright or fatiguing on the eyes.|1
64_22.wav|But if it's a sharp photo or a video detail you're after, then putting a bunch of layers between your eyeballs and the actual display is not the best way to see those details.|1
64_23.wav|And then same thing with contrast, just because of how much brightness is limited, the lack of contrast becomes really obvious.|1
64_24.wav|This one's rated at just 1500 to one contrast ratio, which even when compared to other budget phones is not that great.|1
64_26.wav|People usually put screen protectors on their phones and this one would obviously not make sense to put a screen protector on.|1
64_28.wav|This isn't like a desktop screen where most people are buying it just based on the panel and the visual display properties.|1
64_29.wav|There's a bunch of stuff about a phone people care about,|1
64_30.wav|And it turns out people do not like that trade off.|1
64_31.wav|So I've talked about all kinds of other niche features in the smartphone world and how they're awesome, but won't actually sell.|1
9_0.wav|particularly sharp, the dynamic range or depth of field aren't amazing, like you're not buying this phone to take the greatest, most artistic photos and videos the world has ever seen.|1
9_1.wav|But what you do need is for it to be serviceable, to be quick enough, for autofocus to work, for it to capture a moment, document scanning, video calls, sharing photos with people,|1
9_2.wav|And it does all that and it's totally fine and I can't complain.|1
9_3.wav|And really what's left a bigger imprint on me using this is that compared to their other flagship phones, almost all of the features are still here.|1
9_4.wav|Like the only one I'm not actually seeing on this budget version of the phone is macro mode.|1
9_5.wav|And that, that theme of keeping a lot of the stuff from the more expensive phones and not doing these like artificial cuts, that's what feels good about this phone as a budget phone.|1
9_7.wav|It actually feels like they're trying to give people all of the nothing phone experience for less money.|1
9_9.wav|There's obviously cuts, especially with hardware.|1
9_10.wav|Like, there's no wireless charging, like I said.|1
9_11.wav|It's IP54 instead of IP68.|1
9_12.wav|It's plastic instead of glass and aluminum.|1
9_13.wav|But, I like that once you start to get to use the phone, especially with the software features, experience-wise, I don't feel nearly as many artificial feeling cuts as we've seen on other phones.|1
9_14.wav|Like there's no pro mode in the camera that's missing from the budget phone.|1
9_15.wav|All the same advanced settings, the experimental features, all the home screen features with nothing OS, it's all here on this cheaper phone.|1
9_16.wav|And the crazy part to me is like, they obviously wanna compare this to a lower end phone.|1
9_17.wav|So they compare it to the phone one and my natural instinct is like, I'm ignoring that.|1
9_19.wav|But when you actually look at that two year old phone, you kind of see how far they've come.|1
9_20.wav|And you look at the things that are actually better about this budget phone, this nothing phone 2a has a bigger, brighter|1
124_1.wav|And because of all the pitches on the roof, they estimated they could have put panels down on certain parts and it would have totaled a smaller 19 kilowatt array instead of the 29 kilowatts of the solar tiles.|1
124_2.wav|I know that because that's actually what I first signed up for an estimate for as I was like juggling the idea in my head.|1
124_3.wav|Would that have had a shorter payback period or would that have been offset by much less electricity being produced and taking longer to pay for itself?|1
124_5.wav|But the other part of that equation that I'm thinking about now is just like, I should just use more electricity so that it pays for itself faster.|1
124_7.wav|I am constantly in net negative so I can afford to use way more electricity.|1
124_8.wav|And so I thought maybe about switching, um, you know, various appliances that aren't electric yet.|1
124_9.wav|maybe even switching heating to electrical.|1
124_11.wav|But now for all the miscellaneous weird quirks of having this brand new piece of tech on top of my house, because believe me, there are quite a few.|1
124_12.wav|So first of all, on the zero dollar electricity bill,|1
124_13.wav|For the whole year, that is real, which is pretty awesome.|1
124_14.wav|But it's also interesting that I was able to achieve the $0 bill monthly, but I also used positive net grid energy for those three months during the winter.|1
124_15.wav|So you might be wondering, wait a second, how does that work?|1
124_16.wav|And the answer is net metering credits.|1
124_17.wav|It turns out they roll over month to month.|1
124_18.wav|but then they get reset once per year.|1
124_19.wav|So meaning when it was first activated and in the first full month of August, I produced more than I used.|1
124_20.wav|I ended the month with a credit of the difference, which was negative 255 kilowatt hours.|1
124_22.wav|So that means the next month, even if I used|1
124_23.wav|255 kilowatt hours more than I produce with solar, I would still have a $0 bill, because I have that credit to play with.|1
124_26.wav|So the bill was still $0 every month.|1
124_27.wav|So then another fun thing, power outages.|1
124_28.wav|I have had a few power outages since getting the solar system installed, most of them just because of thunderstorms and the grid going down for a bit.|1
124_29.wav|I didn't even notice, which was pretty sick.|1
124_30.wav|I did not notice the lights didn't even flicker.|1
124_31.wav|I didn't actually know until I got a notification on my phone from the Tesla app saying, hey,|1
124_32.wav|Just so you know, you're disconnected from the grid right now, but you're running off of solar and or batteries right now.|1
124_33.wav|So everything is good and you've got, you know, X amount of hours of backup left and it should get you till the next morning when the sun comes up again.|1
124_34.wav|And there's even a storm watch feature that will preemptively make sure the power walls are full if it knows a big storm is coming.|1
124_35.wav|And honestly, there is a pretty sweet peace of mind knowing for a fact that if I don't charge the car, the power walls have more than enough to just use the house|1
104_0.wav|but want to add that blur later, you can do it with high quality results.|1
104_2.wav|Aside from that, the rest of the phone, I mean, it's the same thing, right?|1
104_3.wav|Same sizes, guys, same ceramic shield, same dust and water resistance, and same starting prices, $799 for the 15.|1
104_4.wav|and $899 for the 15 Plus.|1
104_5.wav|So then there is the pro phones, the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max.|1
104_7.wav|A lot of it I'm actually gonna wanna test just to see if it's actually what they say, but make sure you get subscribed to see those full reviews when they come out later this month and we can figure out if the phones are worth it.|1
104_9.wav|It's not bleeding edge stuff that we've never seen before.|1
104_11.wav|And those are mostly in build quality, the chip inside, and the cameras.|1
104_13.wav|First of all, it's a brand new chip that's called the A17 Pro.|1
104_14.wav|It's the first time they've used the word pro in an iPhone chip.|1
104_16.wav|So it promises some performance and efficiency improvements as a result.|1
104_17.wav|I think I said it's like 10% faster, high performance cores.|1
104_18.wav|and the neural engines up to twice as fast, bunch of other stuff.|1
104_19.wav|Not sure how much of this you'll actually notice in everyday use, but hey, future-proofing and headroom is never a bad thing.|1
104_21.wav|They showed a demo of a game with like faster ray tracing, which isn't new, but you know, it helped make their point.|1
104_22.wav|But the interesting thing to note here with this chip is they mentioned the chip has a new USB 3 controller on it.|1
104_23.wav|which means the 15 and 15 plus don't have that.|1
104_24.wav|So basically that means the Pro iPhone's USB-C port actually gets upgraded USB 3 speeds, the faster data transfer speeds, up to 10 gigabits per second.|1
104_25.wav|But the base iPhones without that controller, they get USB-C, but they're gonna be stuck at USB 2.0 speeds.|1
104_26.wav|Basically the same we've always had with lightning, like 480 megabits per second.|1
104_27.wav|Now this probably won't make a real difference to most people, like I don't know when the last time you plugged your phone in was, but it's kind of a bummer that not all of the benefits of USB-C come to all of the phones.|1
104_28.wav|But for the pro phones that are gonna be shooting more ProRes video or ProRAW photos, I mean it takes forever.|1
104_29.wav|If you've shot this stuff like I have, you know it takes forever to get those off of the phone, because they're big files.|1
104_31.wav|I wish they'd done Thunderbolt speeds, 20, 30, 40 megabits, gigabits per second.|1
104_32.wav|But yeah, it's just gonna be USB 3 on the Pro iPhones and USB 2 on the base iPhones.|1
104_35.wav|Like this, I talked about this on the podcast on Waveform.|1
104_36.wav|I'll try to link the episode below, but like switching to USB-C, you'd think, oh, this is a huge opportunity for Apple to like,|1
104_37.wav|explain why they're doing it and we know why they're doing it, but, oh, why are you giving us this new port and all this, this big new USB-C deal?|1
104_38.wav|And it's, it's just the same 20 or so watt charging we've had for the iPhone for forever.|1
104_40.wav|Kind of figured they would try to do|1
13_1.wav|But the next year we got Samsung Galaxy S4, which was the beginning of a lot of things.|1
13_2.wav|I don't really feel like the fourth generation of any major new product is like the defining one.|1
13_4.wav|Now, of course, they're still making gigantic leaps on paper with specs, because these little pocket computers are getting more and more capable of everything they do.|1
13_5.wav|So it goes from a 4.8 inch 720p screen to being one of the first phones with a five inch|1
13_6.wav|1080p screen in the age of a bunch of new retina displays that are aiming for the best pixel density.|1
13_7.wav|Then they also had variants all the way up from 1.4 to 1.9 gigahertz dual core processors.|1
13_8.wav|It again doubled the RAM from one to two gigabytes.|1
13_9.wav|And that single back camera went from eight megapixels to 13 megapixels.|1
13_10.wav|So this is the first time you could take 1080p videos from the camera on the Galaxy S and then watch them on the 1080p screen on the front of the Galaxy S.|1
13_12.wav|This also goes from a 2,000 milliamp hour battery to a 2,600 milliamp hour battery.|1
13_14.wav|A 30% increase is pretty crazy.|1
13_15.wav|But again, they just keep aiming for one day of battery life.|1
13_16.wav|That's been a theme since this long ago.|1
13_17.wav|Like yes, these things get more and more powerful every year and they're doing more and more stuff.|1
13_18.wav|But as long as they can hit one day of battery life,|1
13_20.wav|Now, if you want more proof of Samsung just trying a ton of things, this phone had a ton of random features.|1
13_21.wav|Some of them actually are kind of interesting because they feel like the AI features of back in this day.|1
13_22.wav|So like this is the phone that tried head tracking smart scrolling.|1
13_23.wav|So when you're reading something, you can tilt your head forward and backward to scroll through the page.|1
13_27.wav|If you have auto rotate on, but you're looking at the screen while reading something and then turn sideways, it won't rotate the screen.|1
13_30.wav|You're watching a video, you look away from the screen, it'll automatically pause.|1
13_33.wav|Some of it sticks, some of it doesn't, fine.|1
13_34.wav|But this was also partially used to justify another increase in price for this phone.|1
13_36.wav|At launch, I don't know if you remember this, it launched at $650.|1
13_37.wav|This is also the first time Samsung made an active version of the phone.|1
13_39.wav|So Galaxy S4, Galaxy S4 Active.|1
13_40.wav|So this added IP67 certification and a more rugged design.|1
13_41.wav|It was a TFT LCD display instead of AMOLED.|1
13_42.wav|And it traded some other small downgrades for like physical buttons and a slightly thicker phone with some flaps to cover the ports.|1
13_43.wav|I'll tell you what was not really a major hit though.|1
13_44.wav|This was one of the first major incidents of a Samsung phone battery swelling, catching fire, and burning up on someone.|1
13_45.wav|Now it didn't go happen to a ton of people, it wasn't enough to become a major trend, but it's something to sort of remember for the future, foreshadowing.|1
13_46.wav|Now by the time we get to Galaxy S5, Samsung is starting to hit their|1
30_1.wav|So in summary, the camera system is new.|1
30_3.wav|It has a new zoom and everything, but all together, it is just like a lot of the other stuff I'm showing you, a little bit better than last year.|1
30_4.wav|And that's going to be good enough for a lot of people.|1
30_6.wav|but if we wanna consider it flagship, it's just, there is a little bit of a gap till it reaches the best.|1
30_7.wav|But I'll tell you what, they even more keep stacking it up.|1
30_8.wav|There are so many little things about using this OnePlus phone that I really like.|1
30_9.wav|Like I love that I can specifically force any app I want|1
30_11.wav|Like there's literally a list of every single app on my phone.|1
30_12.wav|And by default, you've probably noticed all of the mapping apps like Waze and Google Maps, they always, even on every other 120 Hertz phone, they always override and run at 60 Hertz.|1
30_13.wav|But on this phone, I can just fix it.|1
30_15.wav|I also love that this phone has an infrared blaster.|1
30_16.wav|One of the least common features in the world of a modern smartphone alongside like a headphone jack.|1
30_17.wav|But yeah, it literally lets you turn on and off and control appliances remotely without having to find the remote like this TV here or a stranger's TV.|1
30_19.wav|I love that this USB-C port not only supports basically the fastest charging we've ever seen on a phone in the US, but also supports extremely fast data transfer speeds.|1
30_21.wav|The names and generations are horrible at this point and incredibly confusing.|1
30_22.wav|All you really need to know is that this has basically the best data speeds available from a USB-C phone.|1
30_23.wav|So if you get the right cable, you can get large files like videos on and off of the device.|1
30_25.wav|And then a lot of you will probably love that this new screen supports high PWM dimming.|1
30_27.wav|So some smartphones, including this one, are now addressing it with super high pulse width modulation.|1
30_28.wav|Basically they still flicker on and off to get that lower perceived brightness, but much, much faster than the human eye can perceive.|1
30_29.wav|2160 Hertz in this phone's case.|1
30_30.wav|So it still appears liquid smooth at all brightness levels, which is awesome.|1
30_31.wav|If you use your phone in the rain or when it's wet, you probably already know how chaotic that feels.|1
30_33.wav|Like it just seems to kind of act on its own when there's water droplets on the screen.|1
30_34.wav|But this phone claims that with a new technology called AquaTouch,|1
30_35.wav|it will totally remain as usable as ever, even with water all over the screen.|1
30_37.wav|It might sound ridiculous, but it actually works.|1
30_38.wav|It's not perfect, obviously, but you can definitely feel that it's dramatically more responsive to the point where I can actually type things on this wet phone screen, where I just would not want to do that on any other phone without this.|1
30_41.wav|And then there's even just extra little tiny things on top of|1
2_1.wav|This might seem like a hot take, but I've spent a lot of time doing this stuff.|1
2_2.wav|You rarely actually get close to hitting the max and hitting memory swap.|1
2_3.wav|And even when you do, it's very much still fine.|1
2_4.wav|It's when you get into the heavier stuff like media encoding or exporting or gaming that it's a whole nother story.|1
2_5.wav|So if you're watching this video, you already know which group of people you're in.|1
2_6.wav|So for that massive group of people who are doing a lot of that normal baseline computing stuff.|1
2_7.wav|don't buy the new M3 MacBook Air.|1
2_8.wav|You can very easily get an M2 MacBook Air and save your money.|1
2_10.wav|$600, $700 M1 MacBook Airs that they're selling right now.|1
2_11.wav|I think Walmart first announced they would have it for 699.|1
2_12.wav|And then a few days later, Best Buy announced that they'd sell it for 649, which is pretty sick.|1
2_13.wav|So clearly M3 is a much more capable overall chip and brings the floor of the laptop up.|1
2_16.wav|So like me, I edit a lot of videos and so I need a powerful machine for Final Cut Pro and that sort of stuff, right?|1
2_17.wav|So for the longest time, I could only use an Apple desktop, the highest end iMac Pro, the Mac Pro.|1
2_18.wav|And I still will, but I am now able to use Mac studio and I can actually edit.|1
2_19.wav|I've had an M one max MacBook pro for awhile, and I've been editing on the go with a laptop, which is a huge like enabler for me.|1
121_0.wav|plus kilowatt hours of electricity during the day.|1
121_4.wav|So here is a normal fall day in the middle of October.|1
121_5.wav|Production day by day is dropping down now here into the low hundreds.|1
121_6.wav|Uh, this is a day that I got just over 120 kilowatt hours of solar, pretty cloud free day again, as you can tell by the graph.|1
121_7.wav|And again, if you look at the home usage, there's even smaller spikes and a smaller curve of air conditioning during the day.|1
121_8.wav|So the house's needs are actually completely covered by solar.|1
121_9.wav|And then once the sun goes down and the power wall takes over, it actually did not touch the grid at all, which is pretty sick.|1
121_10.wav|And this was actually very common throughout the fall.|1
121_11.wav|Turns out the fall and the spring are the times where I generated the most excess electricity with basically every day ending with net negative.|1
121_12.wav|And then there's winter and|1
121_15.wav|But it also turns out that most of the days are cloudy.|1
121_16.wav|I didn't really realize this like truly until I started looking through all the graphs, but it's like one out of every 10 days is actually sunny.|1
121_17.wav|And I, you know, I know it's cold and everything, but I didn't realize how many days in the winter|1
121_19.wav|So then also my home's, uh, I'm pointing like you can see it.|1
121_20.wav|My home's air conditioning is electric, but my heating is natural gas.|1
121_21.wav|So my natural gas bill is just going up and there's nothing my solar can do about it.|1
121_22.wav|But on top of all that, you got to think about the car and electric cars are far less efficient in the winter when it's cold|1
121_24.wav|Batteries have a certain temperature they like to be at.|1
121_26.wav|So they spend more extra energy getting up to and staying at that temperature.|1
121_27.wav|So a normal drive for me might take, say, 15% of the battery on a commute during the summer.|1
121_28.wav|That same drive during the winter will take 20, 25, 30% of the battery driving the exact same way just because it's so cold.|1
121_29.wav|So that is a lot more electrical energy.|1
121_30.wav|So here's what some typical days in the winter would look like.|1
121_31.wav|Literally only generating 20 to 70 kilowatt hours of electricity in a whole day.|1
121_32.wav|Like cloudy days would literally only be a handful.|1
121_33.wav|And then for home use, so I actually went through this phase of like, maybe I should charge my car less.|1
89_0.wav|lighter, coated and brushed titanium.|1
89_2.wav|And so this phone is actually noticeably lighter than the previous Pro.|1
89_3.wav|It's 10% on paper, but it feels like more than 10%.|1
89_6.wav|This new natural titanium is the best color.|1
89_7.wav|This is the first year I am not ordering a dark or black iPhone.|1
89_9.wav|but they get all kinds of fingerprints on them like crazy.|1
89_10.wav|And also my worries about the light colored scratches, if you go deep enough, were all confirmed by Zach, JRigEverything, in his video, cutting the thing up.|1
89_11.wav|So because I'm on team no case, I'm going with the all gray phone.|1
89_12.wav|I think it looks dope, so I'm going with that.|1
89_13.wav|I think basically the idea is if you have a perfectly working phone, there's no world where you should upgrade to this one just for the titanium build or just for the slightly thinner bezels.|1
89_15.wav|But the real highlight of this build here, let's be honest, is there's a new port at the bottom, that USB type C.|1
89_16.wav|which makes a big difference to people like me who have other gadgets in their life, computers, headphones, mouse, keyboard.|1
89_17.wav|I just bring one charger, it works with everything.|1
89_18.wav|I have already had this rite of passage moment that everyone who gets this phone is gonna have where you have an existing lightning cable and you try to plug it in and then you're like, oh, right.|1
89_19.wav|New cable, but now I've gotten used to it.|1
89_20.wav|But the thing is, I could have sworn Apple would do more with this port.|1
89_21.wav|Like, okay, we know that they're basically forced into doing this by the EU, so shout out to the EU for that.|1
89_22.wav|Now we have a USB iPhone, but like the only pitch is just, hey, one cable for everything.|1
89_24.wav|So like with 30 pin to lightning all those years ago, the benefit was obvious.|1
89_25.wav|It's just so much smaller of a port.|1
89_26.wav|So that let them fit more stuff in the phone.|1
89_28.wav|With this USB type C, it's like, okay, it was already small.|1
89_32.wav|There's no extra like desktop mode, plug it into a monitor and get, there's no decks or anything like that, right?|1
89_33.wav|It's just one cable for everything.|1
89_37.wav|You know, iPhone users can now take advantage of the U in USB-C.|1
89_38.wav|I talked about the handshake it does with plugging directly into other phones and reverse charging them at four and a half Watts in the unboxing video.|1
89_40.wav|You can also plug in other things, plug in a keyboard and type with it, plug in a monitor.|1
89_42.wav|And the pro phone now supports USB 3.0 data transfer speeds.|1
89_43.wav|So you can get that pro res footage off the phone noticeably faster.|1
110_0.wav|malicious and is going to try to upload malware to your device or download photos or something, this cable will not let that happen.|1
110_2.wav|So if you're plugging into an extremely rare public USB-C port, this is actually a great tool to have.|1
110_3.wav|But it's also not that special and it's available on Amazon for like 30 bucks.|1
110_7.wav|One that happens to also be tanking pretty hard and has been tanking for months.|1
110_8.wav|And I also don't even really have to tell you that there's basically no reason for 99.99% of people to buy this.|1
26_0.wav|Ron Hoodie which I'll link it below because you probably want to check it out.|1
26_2.wav|this $300 watch outperformed this $800 smartwatch just in terms of battery.|1
26_3.wav|But now here's the thing, the way that they're achieving this battery life,|1
26_4.wav|is I think more interesting than the battery life itself.|1
26_6.wav|See, most smartwatches have a chip inside computing everything with some high powered cores and some high efficiency cores to balance out power and battery life.|1
26_7.wav|This watch has two entirely separate processors and two different operating systems running for each of them.|1
26_8.wav|So there's a high powered Snapdragon W5 inside, that's powering Wear OS 4, and that only lights up for things connected to that.|1
26_9.wav|Then there's also a BES2700 chip that is always on and runs RTOS, and they both share the same 32 gigs of base storage and 2 gigs of RAM.|1
26_13.wav|It's a hybrid with the best of both worlds, responsiveness and range.|1
26_15.wav|You know, using this thing, it's responsive.|1
26_16.wav|It has a ton of watch faces.|1
26_17.wav|There's a lot of custom workouts, which look very familiar with tracking and everything that still sends all the data to the Ohealth app in plenty of detail for me.|1
26_18.wav|I do still wish now shoveling snow was a workout type, but that's another story.|1
26_19.wav|But you know, these here are regular weightlifting workouts.|1
26_20.wav|And also, can I say, I really like that it is|1
26_21.wav|hold to end the workout, not tap to end.|1
26_22.wav|So it's way harder to accidentally stop a workout.|1
26_25.wav|This button here has a crown that rotates, but that rotation doesn't actually do anything.|1
26_27.wav|It doesn't scroll up or down in anything.|1
26_31.wav|Apparently that's literally just to make it more durable upon impact.|1
50_1.wav|So the result of all that trimming and sculpting is a phone that's, it's definitely still big, but it's much closer to a normal size phone.|1
50_2.wav|It's basically the same size as my Pixel 8 Pro that I've been dailying, but it still has room for the gamery media friendly features.|1
50_3.wav|Like there's still a second USB-C port on the side so you can keep charging while gaming in landscape.|1
50_4.wav|It's still got the remappable shoulder triggers and the rare headphone jack.|1
50_5.wav|And side note, I've been testing a couple in-ear monitors lately and just enjoying using them in all kinds of places.|1
50_6.wav|And this is one of the rare phones that I can actually plug it in.|1
50_7.wav|and use it with, and Asus always throws in a surprising amount of audio adjustment features and a bunch of different profiles and EQ settings that you can play with and make a big difference.|1
50_8.wav|And then, hey, if you're gonna use this daily, people are gonna want the confidence of water resistance, like real water resistance.|1
50_9.wav|Previous gaming phones don't really focus on that too much.|1
50_11.wav|Now, do we still think this looks like a gaming phone?|1
50_12.wav|Honestly, I think they've done a good job of, it's a nice balance.|1
50_13.wav|Like they've done a slow ramp of toning it down a little bit over the years and less RGB and jagged lines and screens on the back and all that sort of stuff.|1
50_14.wav|Now this one, I think the camera bump is the weirdest part, but aside from that, it's pretty subtle.|1
50_15.wav|Like this one's, it's a satin black, so it doesn't show any fingerprints.|1
50_16.wav|It's got a single diagonal glossy strip, which definitely screams or maybe whispers gamer, but I don't mind it.|1
50_17.wav|And then I could probably do without all the texts, the Republic of Gamers text or the good luck, have fun text next to the USB-C port.|1
50_18.wav|But honestly, this is fine, super toned down.|1
50_19.wav|But what if I told you there is still a display on the back of this phone?|1
50_21.wav|Like you literally cannot tell when the screen is off, where it is.|1
50_22.wav|But if you go into the armory crate and turn on anime vision, I don't know why it's called that, but the display then lights up, it comes to life.|1
50_23.wav|It's this all white LED dot matrix display that can show all kinds of things from logos to charging status to incoming call notifications.|1
50_24.wav|and notification counters, et cetera.|1
50_25.wav|Even when you're taking a picture, if there's a countdown timer, it'll do the countdown on the outside screen.|1
50_26.wav|Or even when you're gaming, it'll just tell the world that you're playing a game.|1
50_27.wav|It is definitely certifiably gimmicky.|1
50_28.wav|but I like it anyway for a couple reasons.|1
50_29.wav|One, it's still pretty minimal on the back of the phone here.|1
50_31.wav|It's giving you real useful information on the back of the phone.|1
50_34.wav|You can go through and make special ones just for whatever use case.|1
50_35.wav|And then when the screen is off, you just can't even see it.|1
50_37.wav|And on top of all of that, they even made room for the|1
8_1.wav|And I gotta say, they have a lot of unique, really identifiable things going on here that you may like or dislike, but they're all here.|1
8_2.wav|So aesthetically, they've got the dots everywhere.|1
8_3.wav|So the stock apps have this dots aesthetic and the thin font to go with it.|1
8_4.wav|The back arrow in Android is made of these dots.|1
8_5.wav|And they have this extensive built out selection of nothing widgets now, most of them with the dots theme as well.|1
8_6.wav|So you can have this very consistent home screen aesthetic.|1
8_7.wav|And then there's other little stuff like you can enlarge a single app icon to fill up four spots on your home screen for a unique home screen grid.|1
8_9.wav|There's also this nice little animation with the folders on the home screen.|1
8_10.wav|Also this new thing which lets you add a glass effect to your wallpaper so it's blurred behind your home screen for better visibility.|1
8_12.wav|There's also AI wallpapers now, so you can jump into the wallpaper studio and create the most soulless combo art the world has ever seen in just a few taps.|1
8_13.wav|There's also third-party icon pack support on the home screen with instant one-touch previews.|1
8_16.wav|So this phone still has some lights on the back.|1
8_17.wav|It's less lights in the flagship than the phone 2, but about the same amount of functionality.|1
8_18.wav|So there's one vertical light on the right, and a small one down here on the bottom left, and then the big top one arcing around the top left.|1
8_23.wav|Some of this you may find useful like once or twice.|1
8_24.wav|I almost never use the countdown clock, but the one time I use it, it's kind of cool.|1
8_25.wav|Side note, I couldn't get the glyph composer to work at all on this phone.|1
8_26.wav|The UI worked, but it didn't light up the lights on the back.|1
8_27.wav|But you know, on super close-up photos, maybe the Glyph fill flash is decently useful, sometimes useless other times.|1
8_28.wav|But hey, while we're on the subject, the camera.|1
8_29.wav|The cameras on the back here are serviceable.|1
8_30.wav|Like, it's just practical to have cameras on the back of your phone, and these, they're not good, but they're fine.|1
8_31.wav|I always feel like we go into budget phone reviews kind of knowing, okay, this isn't gonna have|1
8_33.wav|It's not going to be as interesting to test these, but you got to test them anyway and see what they're made of.|1
8_34.wav|So this has a different new 50 megapixel primary camera on the back.|1
8_35.wav|And then it has the same ultra wide camera as the nothing phone too.|1
8_36.wav|And actually also the same selfie camera and look, it can take okay.|1
8_40.wav|I know 50 megapixels is a big number, but here's what I'll say at this level, even in great lighting, the photos aren't|1
103_0.wav|works with other iPhones, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it's just, just a lens to look through this stuff at just to keep an eye on it.|1
103_2.wav|There's the same two sizes again, iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 plus.|1
103_3.wav|And yeah, you know, there's some small changes like the slight soft corner radii on the aluminum rails and the one piece glass back fading between a lighter and darker version of the same color.|1
103_4.wav|Like this new pink one, it's pretty seamless.|1
103_5.wav|Also satin soft touch backs across the whole lineup instead of glossy.|1
103_7.wav|But the big headlining feature really is it's USB now.|1
103_9.wav|These new iPhones are all USB-C across the board.|1
103_10.wav|Now on one hand, this is a huge deal.|1
103_11.wav|Like there's only ever been one port change in the iPhone ever.|1
103_13.wav|30 pin connector thing to this new lightning thing, which we've had ever since.|1
103_14.wav|And now the second one ever is USB type C. But on the other hand, it's, I don't know, it's just USB.|1
103_15.wav|Like it's the same port all these other laptops and tablets all over the planet have had for the past couple of years.|1
103_16.wav|I imagine that might be another year or two before the whole lineup, like the baseline cheap iPad and the iPhone SE and everything else gets USB-C.|1
103_18.wav|We knew it was coming, but it's still kind of surreal to look at an iPhone and see a USB port on it.|1
103_21.wav|First of all, it's the one cable that you can ideally use to charge all your stuff.|1
103_22.wav|So your Mac, your iPad, your iPhone.|1
103_23.wav|your friend's Android phone, the new AirPods, which just got a new USB-C case, all that stuff, one cable.|1
103_24.wav|Oh, and now you can charge accessories like the new AirPods with the wire.|1
103_25.wav|So there's no wireless reverse charging right now, but that C2C cable that comes in the box, you can like plug it into the iPhone, plug it into the AirPods, and charge the AirPods up from the iPhone battery.|1
103_27.wav|But they did hold back on one very key thing, and they saved it for the iPhone 15 Pro.|1
103_30.wav|Aside from that, really, it's a slightly updated phone.|1
103_32.wav|You know, you get the dynamic island here, of course, on these baseline iPhones.|1
103_33.wav|And there's also now a higher peak brightness, 2,000 nits now, which is twice as bright as the iPhone 14s.|1
103_35.wav|The primary camera is now a 48 megapixel chip, presumably the same one that was in the iPhone 14 Pro last year.|1
103_37.wav|And then the rest of the phone really follows that same formula.|1
103_38.wav|They do this thing where the new baseline phone is basically last year's pro phone repackaged.|1
103_39.wav|So it inherits the same A16 bionic chip from last year's pro phone.|1
103_41.wav|and you know, it's also on the pro phone, but I still think it's pretty solid, is the camera has this new next generation portrait mode.|1
103_42.wav|But basically it automatically detects when there's a subject in a photo and captures all of the depth information needed to be able to turn it into a portrait mode photo later.|1
103_43.wav|So you don't have to remember to switch it to portrait mode necessarily every time.|1
123_0.wav|It's time to run the numbers, see if it was really worth it, and see if it's actually good.|1
123_2.wav|This, like I said, was nowhere near the cheapest possible option, of course, going with solar panels and batteries, a lot of different possible setups.|1
123_3.wav|So my setup with the solar tiles, all of the materials, all of the labor, installation, everything, and the three batteries, everything together was $120,948.|1
123_5.wav|But also, as you can see, there's a federal tax credit down here of nearly $30,000, bringing the total cost to me down to right around $93,000.|1
123_6.wav|So the tax credit does fluctuate quite a bit.|1
123_7.wav|It's actually gone up like a lot since I ordered like a year and a half ago, whatever it was.|1
123_9.wav|So it's called the New Jersey Solar Investment Tax Credit.|1
123_10.wav|If I ordered today, it would have been $8,000 more off.|1
123_16.wav|But the main question you typically see with an investment like this is what is the payoff period?|1
123_17.wav|How long does it take before that investment pays for itself in saved electricity?|1
123_19.wav|And I have to do quite a bit of math here because every bill is different.|1
123_20.wav|Every week, every month of electricity costs different amounts.|1
123_21.wav|Actually, my provider literally has different electricity rates every single hour.|1
123_22.wav|And there are different averages per day, per week, per season.|1
123_24.wav|So again, it's a lot, but obviously air conditioning takes up a lot.|1
123_25.wav|And a lot of that is driving an electric car every single day.|1
123_26.wav|So of course, my gas bill has been $0 this whole time, but you know, that's where it comes from.|1
123_27.wav|So if you divide that out, uh, by the total costs that I paid, it comes out to just under 10 years, 9.6 years.|1
123_28.wav|So if you, if you Google like what's a good payback period for a solar setup, the answer that the AI pops up with is like six to 10 years.|1
123_34.wav|Um, I also do know that there are a couple of things that could, that I could, that could have been different to make that payback period shorter.|1
123_35.wav|Now, actually the number one suggestion typically would be like, okay, if you want to make the payback period shorter, get a less expensive setup.|1
123_36.wav|And that would make sense, but also you have to keep in mind the coverage really matters here.|1
123_37.wav|So I could have gone with a much less expensive, actually a solar panel array from Tesla on|1
25_0.wav|could argue it takes cues from maybe the OnePlus 11 or the OnePlus 12 with the way the camera bump is melted into the side rail of the phone.|1
25_1.wav|They've done a similar thing here with the buttons on the side of the watch.|1
25_2.wav|So there's a circular button at the top and this rectangular button at the bottom.|1
25_5.wav|It's got this little subtle classy variation of just the pure circle.|1
25_8.wav|And the whole thing is actually both IP68 dust and water resistant and reaches a US military standard for durability.|1
25_9.wav|Basically means it can also withstand extreme temperature and moisture and shock among other things.|1
25_12.wav|This display goes up to a thousand nits peak brightness.|1
25_14.wav|It's built well across the board.|1
25_18.wav|Well, at the beginning, I mentioned like we already kind of know what a smartwatch is, which is a tiny computer on your wrist with a tiny screen and a tiny battery.|1
25_20.wav|Like they all tend to have pretty short battery lives just because they're so small.|1
25_21.wav|And so you kind of just charge them every day and that's the way it is.|1
25_22.wav|Like the main competitors here are the Apple Watch, which is 18 hours.|1
25_23.wav|Although that's not the most direct competitor, because that's the iPhone, but the Galaxy Watch, one of the best.|1
25_24.wav|40 hours of battery, and the Pixel Watch, the newest one, 24 hours of battery life.|1
25_25.wav|But this one, OnePlus, is claiming 100 hours.|1
25_26.wav|100 hour battery life in smart mode, which is not the battery saving mode, it's actually the default mode out the box.|1
25_28.wav|So 96 hours is four days.|1
25_30.wav|So they just went with a hundred, but four days of battery sounds a lot less inconvenient.|1
25_31.wav|So, you know, I had to put that to the test.|1
25_32.wav|So for the past four straight days, I've been that guy walking around with both an Apple watch ultra, which claims 36 hours of normal use.|1
25_33.wav|And this thing, doing all the same stuff with both watches on, getting notifications, doing workouts, just poking around the UI.|1
25_34.wav|And by the end, I was actually very impressed with both.|1
25_35.wav|So the $800 Apple Watch Ultra actually overperformed the 36 claimed hours for me.|1
25_36.wav|By hour 56, it was about ready to die.|1
25_38.wav|had about 15% left.|1
25_39.wav|Now you're probably thinking, wait, that's not even close to 100 hours.|1
25_41.wav|But OnePlus told me that if you turn the always on display off, that's good for two more days of battery life.|1
25_43.wav|I turned it on for this test, but that would get you well over the 100 hour mark.|1
25_44.wav|To be fair, that's also probably true about the Apple Watch Ultra.|1
25_45.wav|Now one detail to consider that I think actually mattered for this particular test, I've been wearing hoodies a lot because it's that type of weather.|1
25_46.wav|And so even with the sleeves on this Chevrolet,|1
41_1.wav|There's a whole bunch of computer in between me and you right now.|1
41_2.wav|So the eyes aren't on the outside.|1
41_3.wav|It's a representation of my eyes based on what all the sensors on the inside are seeing.|1
41_5.wav|So those sensors are tracking at 90 frames per second and they give you optic ID, which is, it's how you log into the headset and keep things secure.|1
41_6.wav|It's basically the same as face ID or touch ID.|1
41_7.wav|It's just looking at and identifying your eyes.|1
41_8.wav|And it also powers the one,|1
41_9.wav|beta feature of this headset, which is personas, which is, it's the most impressive and weirdest thing about this headset at the same time.|1
41_11.wav|So the purpose of the eyes on the outside is really not for you, the wearer of the headset.|1
41_12.wav|In fact, you'll never see it, but it's for the people around you.|1
41_13.wav|So when you're in a pass-through mode, your eyes will shine through to indicate that|1
41_14.wav|you wearing the headset can see the person outside.|1
41_15.wav|So that right there is already pretty unique.|1
41_16.wav|But then when you're in something immersive and you can't see what's around you, it covers up your eyes with this sort of like a blue, purple glowing animation.|1
41_20.wav|But crazily enough, there's also a feature where if you have someone who's outside the headset looking at you, talking to you, and you are in an immersion, but you want to talk to them through that,|1
41_21.wav|they will kind of appear through the fog of whatever immersive environment you're in.|1
41_22.wav|So you just start talking and looking in their direction.|1
41_23.wav|It detects that and sort of parts a little bit of a fog and that person's eyes will show through the fog.|1
41_25.wav|It basically only shows one person at a time.|1
41_26.wav|And when this is happening on the outside of the headset, it shows a little bit of your eyes poking through the purple and blue glow.|1
41_27.wav|It's, as you can see, it's all working, but also I think it looks nothing like the eyes from the ad.|1
41_28.wav|So in an effort to make the eyes as presentable as possible, two things.|1
41_29.wav|First of all, this screen is actually behind a lenticular film.|1
41_30.wav|which I didn't even realize that from the initial media they've published.|1
41_31.wav|But if you've ever heard of that, it's sort of what gives it like this 3D depth.|1
41_32.wav|You might've seen this on other like holographic displays and stuff.|1
41_33.wav|But the point of that is to make the eyes appear to be sunken into the display, like on your actual face, instead of like...|1
41_34.wav|glued to the front of the headset, which would look a little more weird.|1
41_35.wav|But then two, to represent your actual eyes, they've built in a way to scan in and create a digital representation of your face, which is called your persona.|1
41_37.wav|So to get those eyes on the outside of the Vision Pro headset, you have to do something called registering your persona.|1
41_38.wav|This is how it creates the digital version of you that includes your eyes that will show up here.|1
106_0.wav|from the button press to the app opening, if I'm thinking about this correctly, like it's done in the past, but I'll have to test that for the full review.|1
106_1.wav|But theoretically, you can map this button to open whatever, your calendar app, your to-do list app, whatever app you want, which is totally not what I expected to be on the list of things you could do with a new button on the side of the iPhone.|1
106_3.wav|But then last but not least, the new cameras across the board here.|1
106_4.wav|There's a new larger 48 megapixel main sensor for the pros and improved ultra wide.|1
106_5.wav|And then the Pro Max, just the Pro Max gets a new intricate folding 5X telephoto camera.|1
106_6.wav|I'm guessing if I asked Apple, they would say that there was only enough room in the bigger Pro Max to fit this folding lens.|1
106_9.wav|But until then, the regular 15 Pro is going to still have the 3x telephoto, the regular 3x from last year.|1
106_10.wav|And then we found this seemingly random feature.|1
106_12.wav|They also talked about it in the keynote, but where you can change your default|1
106_13.wav|focal length to be either 1x or 1.2x or 1.5x for some reason.|1
106_14.wav|So it's buried in the middle of the camera settings, but you can tell it to default to one of these specific three focal lengths.|1
106_15.wav|So if you switch back to the camera app, that 1x button is now always going to take you to the new focal length that you've chosen.|1
106_16.wav|And you can still get to 1x or whatever other focal length you want, but I just found that interesting.|1
106_17.wav|So maybe if you somehow, if you're someone that takes 1.2x photos so often that you want a button to get there as fast as possible, because it's the perfect focal length for you, then sure.|1
106_18.wav|Maybe if you're a photographer, you don't want to do the work of digital cropping, just hit that focal length every time, sure.|1
106_19.wav|But there's been a lot of comments that at the end of the day, it feels like USB is literally the biggest headlining new feature of this year's|1
106_21.wav|I can't quite get rid of my lightning cable yet.|1
106_26.wav|There's a couple of things that still are lightning now.|1
106_28.wav|But now I'm genuinely curious if there's going to be a bunch of new USB-C phone accessories because of the iPhone getting USB-C, similar to our sponsor of this video,|1
106_29.wav|So they've made a whole new lineup of products for the iPhone 15, headlined by the Anker Nano, which is like this little small but mighty USB-C power bank that can crank out 30 watts with the built-in USB-C cable.|1
106_31.wav|And if you have that little button up at the top here, it'll actually show a literal percentage of how much battery you have left.|1
106_32.wav|Or if you're plugged in, it'll show you a time, which counts down so you really know exactly how much of the 10,000 milliamp hours you have left.|1
106_34.wav|There's a wall charger, braided USB-C cables galore.|1
106_35.wav|So feel free to learn more about Anker's new lineup at the link below.|1
106_37.wav|So iPhone 15 Pro will start at the same price as last year, which is $999, but they've bumped up iPhone 15 Pro Max.|1
77_0.wav|wherever they are in the room, just pick them up and put them down without needing someone to hand them to you.|1
77_2.wav|There's also just a small amount of distortion with up close objects and things near the edges of your vision.|1
77_3.wav|But it's not quite high enough fidelity to like pick up your phone and start using that screen.|1
77_4.wav|So like if you get a text, you're still gonna have to take the headset off to be able to read it.|1
77_5.wav|And I know comparing it to a $3,500 headset feels unnecessary, and it kind of is, but also a lot of people have asked me about it, and I am one of the few people who can actually say they've tried both.|1
77_6.wav|So I will say that, yes, Apple Vision Pro is still the best pass-through I've ever experienced.|1
77_7.wav|I distinctly remember taking notes about my experience on my phone while still wearing the headset.|1
77_9.wav|But for a $500 headset, yeah, this is absolutely as good as you're gonna see.|1
77_10.wav|And combined with the high resolution of the actual menus and the accuracy of the controllers, I think it's pretty awesome.|1
77_11.wav|And then of course, the other benefit to having way higher quality sensors around the outside of the headset is you don't actually need|1
77_13.wav|Now you've always had the choice to either use the controllers or use your hands.|1
77_17.wav|They have better haptics than ever before.|1
77_18.wav|But the hand tracking has also gotten way better and really intuitive and responsive.|1
77_19.wav|And I think this is key again to feeling like the future.|1
77_20.wav|So you do this pinch gesture here to pull up the menu and move around to select things.|1
77_21.wav|You can literally scroll around menus by|1
77_22.wav|touching the digital menu and flinging them through space with your finger, or you can grab a window and just move it around, putting it on a table or floating it in the air and it just stays locked there, which is pretty awesome.|1
77_23.wav|So pretty much everything except typing is natural.|1
77_24.wav|It works as you'd expect, like you're typing on a virtual keyboard floating in space, but this will definitely take more practice because there's no haptic feedback.|1
77_26.wav|almost always have a haptic feedback of your own fingers hitting each other, which is really interesting.|1
77_27.wav|This keyboard here, you're sort of just poking an invisible plane in the air where the keyboard should be.|1
77_29.wav|The main selling point of this headset though, is still playing games.|1
77_31.wav|And it plays all the same games that the Quest 2 could play.|1
77_32.wav|And there are even some games optimized for Quest 3 that it's even better at.|1
77_33.wav|It has this next gen Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chip.|1
77_34.wav|It has higher resolution per eye.|1
77_35.wav|It has a wider, more immersive field of view.|1
77_36.wav|And it's in my opinion, slightly more comfortable thanks to this new strap that improves weight distribution.|1
77_38.wav|I've really enjoyed this golf game that feels surprisingly realistic as someone that was expecting like Wii golf levels of graphics and control.|1
77_39.wav|Also ping pong, which this has this eerie multiplayer mode online where someone else's avatar just shows up in your space standing 10 feet away from you, but with no legs.|1
77_40.wav|But there's, you know, the classics like Beat Saber, Superhot, and then even some new ones like Gorilla Tag is blowing up.|1
77_41.wav|All this stuff is the main reason why today you'd buy something like this to spend like half an hour in the thing.|1
77_42.wav|But again, the tech is shrinking down more and more and more and|1
44_2.wav|It's all very subtle, but very well considered.|1
44_3.wav|So once you're in this a while, you start to notice all these little smaller things.|1
44_4.wav|Again, it's not quite human-like.|1
44_5.wav|It's not like looking at a video feed of a human face.|1
44_6.wav|but it is still like, it has a lot of like, this would be the best avatar anyone's ever made in 2K.|1
44_7.wav|Like no one's ever done a 2K face scan and had it look this good, but it's still not as good as like a perfect reality.|1
44_8.wav|It's a, you've heard the uncanny valley thing before.|1
44_9.wav|I think the number one weakness for the avatars or the,|1
44_11.wav|any makeup you had on or however you looked when you did the scan.|1
44_13.wav|Maybe you did a scan when you were looking all dolled up and then you get on a 7 a.m.|1
44_14.wav|call and you still look perfect even though you look like you just woke up in real life.|1
44_15.wav|So I guess, I guess there's that too.|1
44_16.wav|But anyway, all that is to say FaceTime, FaceTime is the most well, well thought out, like most futuristic Vision Pro experience.|1
44_19.wav|Now you know what it's like to use and operate the Vision Pro.|1
44_23.wav|Like there are parts of this thing that are absolutely amazing, unparalleled, best I've ever seen.|1
44_24.wav|But the reason it's so interesting is because it's actually a young category.|1
44_25.wav|Like we're so used to this slow, boring iteration in mature categories like smartphones and laptops.|1
44_26.wav|And you always see the comments talking about how tech is so boring, but now they're actually jumping into something risky and it's actually fun.|1
44_27.wav|And there is downfalls and flaws and it's fun to actually weigh the pros and cons.|1
44_28.wav|So I'll be expanding on all of these way more in the full review, but I'll leave you with this.|1
113_0.wav|the easiest and most straightforward for most people to use.|1
113_1.wav|It's like they hate changing things for no good reason.|1
113_2.wav|The calculator has basically been unchanged for years.|1
113_3.wav|Now there's also downsides to that, like Siri has basically been ignored since it was introduced.|1
113_4.wav|But still, like Apple moves the call end button by like 200 pixels to the middle of the screen and people freak out about it.|1
113_5.wav|Sometimes it feels like Android versions will just move stuff around just kind of to try it and for the sake of changing things.|1
113_6.wav|And sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, they'll move it back.|1
113_7.wav|And that's interesting and exciting sometimes, but that does hurt just user continuity and ease of use.|1
113_8.wav|Maybe not for you watching this video, but just think for the average person, like for your five closest friends, think about how they use their phone.|1
113_10.wav|Then throw on top of that, there's basically never any bloatware loaded onto the iPhone ever.|1
113_11.wav|And then customer service is basically always better for an iPhone because Apple stores are everywhere and Apple controls that entire experience for better or for worse.|1
113_13.wav|So it's just for people who are not enthusiasts, who just want to get the thing and not think about it anymore.|1
113_14.wav|they pretty much always go with the iPhone.|1
113_15.wav|So ease of use is a checkbox for the iPhone.|1
113_16.wav|By the way, if you're enjoying this video, get subscribed.|1
113_19.wav|All right, so we've got to talk about updates.|1
113_20.wav|So number four is support.|1
113_21.wav|So this is something that I would classify as kind of underrated just because I don't think enough people buy their new phone that they plan on having for years with this in mind.|1
113_22.wav|I think having the latest and greatest updates, software, and security patches as quick as possible and as long as possible|1
113_23.wav|should be a priority, but it usually isn't for people.|1
113_24.wav|Either way, it's kind of a mixed bag across the board.|1
113_25.wav|In Android world, some companies make no promises or they kind of break their promises.|1
113_26.wav|Some have short promises, and some will actually extend out to promising three to four years of software updates.|1
113_28.wav|but none of them really come close to the iPhone.|1
113_29.wav|When iOS 17 comes out this fall, every iPhone back to the iPhone XR from 2018 is officially supported and gonna get the latest version.|1
113_30.wav|That's five major software version updates.|1
113_31.wav|I don't think there are any Android phones from 2018 that are gonna get the latest version of Android 14 when it comes out.|1
113_32.wav|So this one easily goes to the vertically integrated Apple phone with the Apple software,|1
113_34.wav|So now my number five category is apps.|1
76_0.wav|But we're all kind of on board that maybe someday the tech will shrink down more and more and more and more until eventually it's no more than just a normal looking pair of glasses.|1
76_1.wav|And then maybe at that point, we'll all be cool wearing it every day.|1
76_2.wav|So this Quest 3, this newest and latest and greatest headset from Meta, my theory is, is on this side of the scale.|1
76_3.wav|And on the other side of the sliding scale,|1
76_5.wav|And Meta literally is also announcing smart glasses at their event.|1
76_6.wav|So these things are literally called the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, AKA the Ray-Ban Stories 2.|1
76_8.wav|They don't do much because they can only fit a camera and small speakers and a battery, but there are some clever tricks that enable them to do as much as possible.|1
76_9.wav|And maybe someday the tech will get powerful enough and useful enough for people to wanna use these every day.|1
76_10.wav|So VR headsets are racing to get smaller and smaller and smart glasses are racing to get better and better tech.|1
76_11.wav|And they're both basically racing towards each other.|1
76_12.wav|And companies like Meta are spending tons and tons of money to develop these things to figure out which strategy will hit first.|1
76_16.wav|So this is the latest and greatest from Meta, the Quest 3.|1
76_17.wav|And this is the year they made their big pivot to it being a mixed reality headset, which in hindsight feels like a natural progression for these things if you want to get them more comfortable for people to wear every day like glasses.|1
76_18.wav|So in previous VR headsets, it really felt like pass through was an afterthought.|1
76_20.wav|and you're just immediately in your own world until you take the headset off.|1
76_21.wav|And this new version is still built to be immersive.|1
76_22.wav|It still has all the light blocking and fills your field of view with screens and makes it as immersive as possible.|1
76_23.wav|But it now has a bunch more sensors arranged around the outside that make pass-through dramatically better than before.|1
76_24.wav|It's now color, stereo, very low latency and decently high resolution.|1
76_25.wav|And there's immediately a bunch of benefits to having passthrough being this good.|1
76_26.wav|First of all, the setup was way more intuitive.|1
76_27.wav|Like you can literally take it to a new spot for the first time and just put it on, it boots up, and automatically you look down and it just maps out the floor of the room you're in.|1
76_28.wav|The available floor space, the objects in the room, the spots where you can stand, and to surprisingly great accuracy.|1
76_29.wav|So it's using a pair of RGB cameras and the LiDAR sensor in the middle.|1
76_30.wav|So you no longer have to painstakingly draw a play area every single time and stick with it.|1
76_31.wav|It just naturally feels like it plants the menu floating right in the middle of where you're standing and you can still see everything around you.|1
76_32.wav|Now you may be wondering, okay, how good though exactly is the Quest 3?|1
76_34.wav|Is it better than the Quest Pro?|1
76_35.wav|Yes, it's better than the Quest Pro, but it is not as good as Apple Vision Pro.|1
76_36.wav|I would kind of equate it to like if I gave you a clear pair of glasses that were not exactly your prescription.|1
76_37.wav|But basically this one's good because it's stereo and color and nearly real time.|1
76_38.wav|So you see accurate colors, you look at your hands and you can find the controller|1
129_2.wav|So yeah, C, C plus for battery.|1
129_3.wav|But I want to talk about the software experience here because it is a pixel after all, and there is one weird thing.|1
129_4.wav|So this was a very interesting phone to test because Google had to do a lot of software work and I was excited to try all of it.|1
129_6.wav|are all these beautiful tablet-optimized apps now.|1
129_7.wav|They're so thoughtfully designed for the phone with this size screen.|1
129_8.wav|They all look normal on the outside screen, but on the inside, Google Drive has this nice slide-out sidebar and multi-column view.|1
129_9.wav|Gmail's new multi-column view is great.|1
129_10.wav|The weather app, the new weather app is absolutely fantastic.|1
129_11.wav|Google Calendar is completely redesigned.|1
129_13.wav|And then the new dock sort of ties it all together.|1
129_14.wav|So this dock I talked about on the Pixel tablet, you swipe up slightly from the bottom and the home bar turns into your home screen dock.|1
129_15.wav|So this is the apps that you have on the bottom of your home screen.|1
129_16.wav|And you can quickly switch between these apps or launch into multitasking super easily.|1
129_17.wav|So just like the other folding phones, I feel like|1
129_18.wav|I feel like I'm multitasking God when I'm using this huge folding phone open and just typing away.|1
129_19.wav|But here is the weird part.|1
129_20.wav|As far as I can remember, every other foldable phone allows you to set up the home screens and stuff on the outside screen.|1
129_21.wav|And then the inside screen is separate.|1
129_22.wav|You can have a separate set of widgets.|1
129_23.wav|You can go crazy and make a different layout on the inside here.|1
129_24.wav|And on this phone, you cannot do that.|1
129_25.wav|So look, right now my outside screen is these three pages, this one with the icons and the weather, and then this calendar widget one, and then this third one.|1
129_26.wav|So when I open up the phone, that's exactly mirrored here.|1
129_27.wav|The left one is the first home screen, then the right one is the second one, and I swipe over and here's the third one.|1
129_28.wav|But if I like take this raindrop icon and move it over here,|1
129_29.wav|And then when I go back to closed, it's also moved the raindrop icon there because it's keeping them exactly mirrored at all times, which is fine.|1
129_30.wav|I think that actually makes a lot of sense, especially for beginners.|1
129_31.wav|Like I, I bet if, if Apple made a folding iPhone right now, they would do the exact same thing.|1
129_32.wav|Cause iPhone users are used to not having a ton of customization on their home screens, but.|1
109_0.wav|kind of weak cameras, weak battery, not that amazing of a screen, but it's stock Android and good build.|1
109_2.wav|So that's why literally less than a year after it came out, the price plummeted from a thousand to $600.|1
109_3.wav|So now the real question is, would you pay, would anybody pay $600 for a barely above average, well-built Android phone that happens to have some crypto features built in?|1
109_4.wav|I guess this is the part where I have to go over all of the crypto and web3 features.|1
109_5.wav|So, all right, like I mentioned earlier, there's three things that make this a crypto phone.|1
109_6.wav|So the Solana mobile stack is an SDK for apps to connect to the Solana blockchain, which, I mean, it's cool that it's built in, but the obvious downside being this does not work with any other blockchain.|1
109_7.wav|So no Bitcoin, no Litecoin, no Ethereum.|1
109_8.wav|This is just focused on the Solana blockchain.|1
109_9.wav|Then the Seed Vault is basically dedicated storage of a 24 phrase seed stored in a secure environment where the Android OS cannot see them.|1
109_11.wav|And then the last feature is something I've been calling a dApp Store, which is literally a second app store on this device that's specifically for crypto apps, crypto focused stuff.|1
109_13.wav|OKX, a crypto exchanges on here, Brave Browser, things like that.|1
109_14.wav|There's an app called Minty Fresh that lets you turn photos from your camera roll into NFTs in a few seconds and a few clicks, if you're into that, I guess.|1
109_15.wav|But those are the only three things that really make this a crypto phone.|1
109_16.wav|And one of them, the dApp Store is not really even that special because it is coming to other phones and you'll be able to get it on a non-crypto phone.|1
109_18.wav|Now the other stuff, I think you can actually make an argument is|1
109_19.wav|really, really cool to have built into the phone and actually secure like that.|1
109_20.wav|And if you are in the Solana ecosystem, this is the only place you can get that stuff.|1
109_21.wav|But man, I feel like that's about the most niche feature possible.|1
109_22.wav|Like remember, we were just talking about the Zenfone 10, how I love that phone.|1
109_24.wav|It's just a shame it won't sell because not as many people like small phones.|1
109_25.wav|Do you think the number of people who are in the Solana ecosystem and want to buy a phone that has some of those features built in|1
109_26.wav|is greater than or less than the number of people who want a small phone.|1
109_27.wav|Basically, the number one coolest thing to come out of this project, to me, is exposing me to this thing right here, which is the cable that comes in the box for this phone.|1
109_28.wav|This is a braided USB-C to USB-C cable, but not just any cable.|1
109_29.wav|At the end here is a hard switch that blocks all data and only lets power through, just making it a charging cable.|1
109_30.wav|And that's actually pretty sick, highly effective for preventing something called juice jacking attacks, where if you plug into like a public outlet somewhere, but that outlet is maligned.|1
102_2.wav|I'm sure the coating does some other great stuff during the daytime, but there's still flare issues, sadly.|1
102_3.wav|But also lastly, I wanna clarify the new camera behavior on the Pro phones.|1
102_4.wav|In the impressions video, I was a little down on the whole like 1X versus 1.2X versus 1.5X thing, because I thought it was literally just a digital crop, which would be pretty pointless to me.|1
102_5.wav|but it's actually closer to a set of Super Res Zoom presets that you can actually then digitally zoom between.|1
102_6.wav|I'll detail all of this in the full reviews.|1
102_7.wav|And here's some benchmark scores in case you're curious about that sort of thing for performance for the A17 Pro, which is actually new.|1
102_8.wav|But generally, I think that wraps up my first, second impressions, my second look now that I got them in the studio.|1
102_9.wav|Really, I feel like the base iPhone 15s, if you're thinking if you wanna buy one of these or pre-order,|1
96_0.wav|Ultra 2 is the same spec bump over the original Ultra.|1
96_1.wav|Basically, there's one new color, this pink on the Series 9 that I have, and it's pretty similar to the new pink iPhone.|1
96_2.wav|It's this kind of light salmon-y colored one.|1
96_3.wav|Aside from that, honestly, you could never even tell if someone is wearing the new watch.|1
96_4.wav|Matter of fact, I've been wearing around this new Ultra 2 for more than a week now.|1
96_6.wav|Nobody can tell because it looks exactly the same.|1
96_7.wav|There were some rumors floating around of heavily speculating on a black Apple Watch 2.|1
96_9.wav|And it seemed like something everybody agreed was probably gonna happen.|1
96_10.wav|And it made a lot of sense because there's always something Apple does just to visually distinguish the new one from the not so new one.|1
96_11.wav|But what I think happened was Apple got to testing it and then they started to realize just what happens to a coated titanium on a durable focused item like a watch.|1
96_12.wav|So kind of similar to the new iPhone, there's these new colors with PVD coating on top of titanium for the iPhone 15 Pro.|1
96_13.wav|But it's a phone, so people put it in a case and they're a little bit more careful with it.|1
96_14.wav|But on an adventure watch where you expect people to run around outside and beat it up and scrape it and drag it through rocks and sand and stuff, I think they realize that might have a tough time wearing well.|1
96_17.wav|So either way, okay, what is the new spec bump?|1
96_18.wav|It's the S9, the new S9 chip inside this phone or the system in package, the SIP as they call it.|1
96_19.wav|Literally everything that's new about these watches stems from this S9.|1
96_20.wav|So first of all, it's a faster chip, which just means generally flying around the UI and opening and closing apps and notifications and stuff.|1
96_21.wav|Like that all is technically faster.|1
96_22.wav|Honestly, not super noticeable just because you really don't do a ton of that on the watch.|1
96_23.wav|And the refresh rate is exactly the same, but you know what?|1
96_25.wav|But then it's also a more power-efficient chip, which you'll always love to see in a small battery gadget like a watch.|1
96_26.wav|But Apple actually targets the same 18-hour battery life that they always do, and instead, cranks the maximum brightness of the new Series 9 display up to 2,000 nits, thanks to new DisplayDriver silicon.|1
96_27.wav|And on the Ultra 2, that now goes from 2,000 up to 3,000 nits max brightness.|1
96_28.wav|So unsurprisingly, they look great outdoors.|1
96_29.wav|You don't necessarily look at it right away and notice it's brighter.|1
96_30.wav|It's really only when you put it side by side with the last one that you can at least appreciate how impressive this is.|1
96_31.wav|3000 nits is actually the brightest display Apple has ever put in any gadget they've ever made.|1
96_32.wav|The S9 package also includes a new ultra wideband chip that enables precision finding of your iPhone.|1
96_33.wav|So basically find my iPhone before on the watch was just pinging a sound to play from your iPhone.|1
96_34.wav|But now with the watch, you can have it direct you to find exactly where your phone is.|1
96_35.wav|Kind of like finding an air tag, even more useful if your phone is like in between some couch cushions or something, or if it's playing sound echoing in a weird way.|1
96_36.wav|I think this is a great ecosystem feature.|1
107_0.wav|If you took the crypto out of this phone, it would at least have potential.|1
107_3.wav|So the story of this phone actually starts all the way back with the Essential Phone.|1
107_4.wav|So I don't know how many of y'all remember the Essential Phone back in 2017, but that was a really interesting and exciting new development in the smartphone world.|1
107_5.wav|We don't get that many genuinely promising new phone companies coming along and doing good things.|1
107_6.wav|but that's exactly what this Andy Rubin startup was promising when they came out with their first phone.|1
107_7.wav|It was just this refreshing sort of minimal design.|1
107_8.wav|There were no protruding camera bumps, no big logos or branding.|1
107_9.wav|They were one of the first to do this camera notch here at the top of the screen with the thin bezels, and they were one of the only ones|1
107_10.wav|using these super premium materials, the titanium rails and polished ceramic on the back.|1
107_11.wav|And then it just had some pins on the back with some magnets for attaching some modular accessories.|1
107_12.wav|Just some genuinely interesting, really cool ideas on top of some super clean software.|1
107_13.wav|Now, unfortunately, this experiment|1
107_15.wav|You know, this unfortunate combination of high price, mediocre cameras, not that strong of a feature set for regular people to care, launching as a Sprint exclusive.|1
107_16.wav|All of this led to extremely low sales.|1
107_17.wav|And then the company would go on to dynamite itself after a bunch of info about Andy Rubin comes out.|1
107_18.wav|And so we would not get to see a second try in a central phone too.|1
107_19.wav|Now it sucks to see a promising company with a ton of talent just disappear like that.|1
107_20.wav|But something that happens a lot, a lot of times when these businesses dissolve, is the teams that worked on stuff sometimes will pop up somewhere else and work on something else.|1
107_21.wav|And so sure enough, in 2020, a bunch of the engineers from the original Essential team got back together to form a new company called Awesome, and they would announce their first project, the Awesome OV-1.|1
107_22.wav|basically the spiritual successor to the Essential Phone.|1
107_23.wav|And you can see a lot of similarities and continuity in this announcement.|1
107_24.wav|They talked about these crazy materials again, this titanium and polished ceramic and the rectangular design.|1
107_25.wav|But they also then tried to correct a bunch of the things that doomed the original Essential Phone.|1
107_26.wav|It is noticeably bigger and with a bigger screen, bigger battery, et cetera.|1
107_27.wav|But, shocker, they didn't really get enough interest in this brand new startup phone to be able to bring this whole idea back to life.|1
107_28.wav|It's the classic enthusiast phone problem where like it's a cool idea and some people really, really want it, but there's not enough hype to be able to make the whole thing happen.|1
107_29.wav|That is until Solana came along.|1
107_30.wav|So Solana is a Web3 company looking for new projects, and Awesome is this hardware team looking for some backing to make this phone happen.|1
107_31.wav|So Solana would bring the cash and bring their backing, Awesome would bring their hardware talent, and they'd partner together to turn the OV1 into this rebranded Solana Saga Chromebook.|1
101_1.wav|I don't know, I leave my phone on mute most of the time anyway.|1
101_2.wav|So you can also have it open up the camera in any of the camera modes, but then again, the camera shortcut is like right on your lock screen already and I'm pretty used to that.|1
101_3.wav|Same thing with the flashlight, you could do that, but it's also already on everyone's lock screen.|1
101_5.wav|It's actually pretty convenient because it immediately starts recording when you press and hold the button.|1
101_6.wav|But my favorite, by a mile, is the Siri shortcuts function because it basically lets you do anything else.|1
101_7.wav|You can have it, you can stack up a bunch of different functions that are like location dependent, or you can have it call a certain contact or do certain things, or if you just want to literally open any app on your phone with zero lag.|1
101_8.wav|So it could be your to-do list app, or your calendar app, or just open YouTube with any one button press.|1
101_10.wav|For me, I'm gonna map my action button on my brand new iPhone to the Google Assistant, the best assistant available on the iPhone.|1
101_11.wav|Also Apple, if you're listening, I also wish you could map a double press or a triple press of the action button to a new specific function.|1
101_13.wav|Also, I was kind of curious how cases would handle this new action button.|1
101_14.wav|So I asked channel sponsor dbrand to send over their new ghost case and I have it here.|1
101_16.wav|I think this matte black skeleton design looks sick.|1
101_17.wav|And yes, I can confirm that even with the case, the action button still feels nice and clicky.|1
101_18.wav|Now you might be thinking, all right, what's so special about this clear case?|1
101_20.wav|And between the Skeleton and MagSafe, there's a bunch of other stuff.|1
101_21.wav|But my favorite personally is, if you've ever owned a clear case before, you probably know that after a while, it kind of ends up looking like this, which is disgusting and yellow.|1
101_22.wav|But dbrand has promised me that they've specifically engineered the ghost case to be impossible to yellow.|1
101_24.wav|So they actually give you like a lifetime case replacement guarantee if it ever yellows.|1
101_25.wav|So that's either a real promise or free cases for life, the way I see it.|1
101_26.wav|Either way, if you're interested, I'll leave a link below the like button if you wanna check it out.|1
101_28.wav|Now, I've also been taking some pictures and videos with these new cameras to get a sense of how they perform.|1
101_29.wav|I will be taking many, many more, posting them on Twitter if you want to follow me there, Instagram as well.|1
101_30.wav|I also fully plan on shooting the next autofocus car channel video with this phone.|1
101_31.wav|So you already know you can go subscribe over there to see how the video looks, to hear how the microphone sound.|1
101_32.wav|One thing that they did mention in the keynote specifically was there was a new coating over the lenses that I immediately thought, oh, does this fix the horrible nighttime flare issues with the iPhone's video?|1
101_33.wav|First thing I did was go to a dark room, bring it out at night.|1
24_0.wav|400, 500, 600 bucks right up to the $900 ceiling for the base Galaxy S. This is the base phone.|1
24_1.wav|Now the most expensive phone has of course gotten dramatically more expensive too.|1
24_2.wav|So again, that ceiling lifting with the ultra has allowed Samsung to go way up to $1,300 starting.|1
58_0.wav|thing in the world, like it's cool that it can do complex math and reasoning and generate new things for you, but then it can't see your calendar or tell you the weather or do anything current events related, so that didn't last long.|1
58_1.wav|So then I switched to starting a new dialog box for a new task in my to-do list app of choice, TickTick, and this one's pretty cool.|1
58_2.wav|You hit the button and it literally opens a text box and you just start typing a new task.|1
58_3.wav|Really, really nice if you just happen to remember something somewhere.|1
58_4.wav|But I also totally still have the muscle memory to just go home and open the app whenever I need it.|1
58_6.wav|So it was a little bit redundant for me.|1
58_7.wav|So I've ended up with my action button just being set to open the camera.|1
58_8.wav|and that's the fastest, most convenient way to get to the camera for me.|1
58_10.wav|You can actually have it open to take a selfie or take some other types of photos or videos.|1
58_11.wav|I just have it open the viewfinder and I'm good.|1
58_12.wav|So then of course, USB type C was the biggest headlining feature of this newest generation of iPhones, hilariously enough.|1
58_14.wav|First of all, thank you Europe.|1
58_16.wav|Even as someone who is a pretty heavy wireless charger user, I do have to say it is much nicer.|1
58_17.wav|It's been great to just have one cable to charge almost everything from this iPhone to any Android phone, to the iPad Pro, to my laptop.|1
58_18.wav|But unfortunately I have not been able to get rid of my lightning cable just yet because there are still other things in my ecosystem, in Apple's ecosystem that haven't switched to USB-C quite yet.|1
58_19.wav|Mostly because AirPods Max is my|1
58_20.wav|headphones for traveling of choice, and I still have to carry the lightning cable everywhere just to charge those.|1
58_21.wav|But there's also still the Magic Keyboard and the Apple Magic Trackpad.|1
58_22.wav|I really don't know how long it's going to take Apple to go through and also update all of these things to be USB Type-C.|1
58_23.wav|but I guess my lightning cables are sticking around a little while longer until they refresh all that stuff.|1
58_24.wav|The AirPods Max came out at the end of 2020, so word on the street is they may be due for a refresh sometime soon, but we don't know.|1
58_25.wav|Definitely get subscribed to see the review of the new ones whenever they do come out, but as of right now...|1
58_27.wav|So there have been several software updates to the iPhone 15 lineup since it came out.|1
58_28.wav|It launched on iOS 17, which made all types of headlines, but then we've already made it to iOS 17.2.|1
58_29.wav|The new journal app is live now, which I have a few friends that use, but I don't use it.|1
58_30.wav|There's of course been a bunch of bug fixes and optimizations since we heard about, you know, the Instagram app and those random heat problems.|1
58_31.wav|Those seem to also be fixed and gone.|1
58_32.wav|And there's also a curious new little button in the camera app.|1
133_0.wav|at $3,500 and it'll go on sale starting sometime early next year.|1
133_1.wav|Nobody's been able to shoot video of using it yet, so I'm gonna have to do my best with descriptions here, but fundamentally this isn't something that's paired to your iPhone or your Mac by default.|1
133_2.wav|It's a standalone computer with an M.2 chip inside, its own Wi-Fi connection, a roughly 4K micro OLED display for each eye,|1
133_4.wav|So alright then, how does it work?|1
133_5.wav|Well, basically, we've seen VR headsets and AR headsets before.|1
133_6.wav|Typically, there's screens on the inside, and then on the outside, there's some sort of shell which has some sensors on the outside that help detect what is in your room around you and help to see the controllers in your hands.|1
133_7.wav|But with this one, there are no controllers at all.|1
133_11.wav|You are controlling this thing entirely with your hands.|1
133_12.wav|and your eyes and your voice.|1
133_13.wav|So you put this headset on and basically all over the headset there are an absolute ton of sensors.|1
133_14.wav|You have two main forward-facing cameras, two downward-facing cameras, two more cameras for the sides, two infrared illuminators, a lidar scanner, a true depth camera.|1
133_15.wav|These are all to keep track of what's happening around the headset and also to track|1
133_17.wav|And then on the inside, there's also a bunch of infrared illuminators and infrared cameras that are purely there, just there, to track your eyes.|1
133_18.wav|So there's actually a setup process before you even get the headset.|1
133_19.wav|You basically measure, you sort of scan your face with the TrueDepth camera on the iPhone, and it uses that depth information about your face to give you a sort of a custom cutout.|1
133_20.wav|This will be a process that you can do in Apple stores, but basically you get the headset with the custom cutout for your face.|1
133_21.wav|If you have glasses, there are some Zeiss lenses, but you finally get the headset out and you put it on and there's some nice meshing on the back, some fabric that stretches and is pretty breathable.|1
133_22.wav|It's built extremely well with all this metal and glass.|1
133_23.wav|And then once you get it going, the most impressive thing about this headset, the most impressive thing is the eye tracking.|1
133_25.wav|This, this eye tracking is sick.|1
133_26.wav|So basically the eye tracking in this headset, as it looks at your eyes and keeps track of where your eyes move around is the closest thing that I've experienced to like magic.|1
133_27.wav|Like I don't, I normally don't call tech things sort of magical or surreal like this, but this was,|1
133_28.wav|Even for a pre-release product, kind of unbelievable how well it does.|1
133_29.wav|Anytime you move your eyes around the UI, it would immediately highlight and select exactly what you're looking at, no matter how small the target was or what you're looking at.|1
133_30.wav|And then when you want to select something, all you do is take your fingers like this and just touch them together.|1
51_0.wav|first ever wireless charging in an ROG phone.|1
51_1.wav|So these gaming phones have always had so much chaos going around on the back of the phone with these screens and lights that they just, they never had room for wireless charging.|1
51_2.wav|And I was totally fine because gamers just weren't interested.|1
51_4.wav|they've actually made the space for it.|1
51_5.wav|One thing I'll say though, the coil is a little higher up here than normal.|1
51_7.wav|And so I think it's a little higher than most other phones.|1
51_8.wav|Cause if I put the phone on a vertical wireless charger like this, it actually doesn't line up and it doesn't charge.|1
51_9.wav|But I discovered that if I turn it sideways,|1
51_10.wav|it does charge so you may have to play with that a little bit.|1
51_11.wav|And you know lots of people don't use wireless charging and that's fine but just feels like this is something you have to offer to be considered one of the high-end versatile flagships.|1
51_12.wav|Even if you never use that there's still 65 watt wired charging with the brick that is yes included in the box.|1
51_14.wav|I would literally say, the camera is pretty bad, but it's a gaming phone.|1
51_15.wav|That's not one of the reasons that you're buying this phone.|1
51_17.wav|But in a phone that you want to package and sell as a mainstream phone, that goes from an afterthought to literally one of the most important pieces of this phone.|1
51_19.wav|Well, this is an all new camera system for the ROG phone.|1
51_20.wav|It's a 50 megapixel primary camera, a 3X telephoto for the first time, and a 13 megapixel ultra wide.|1
51_21.wav|It's more hardware than before, but I would say it's somehow still feels behind the Zenfone 10, which is also made by Asus.|1
51_22.wav|Like, are those branches of the company even talking to each other?|1
51_23.wav|This primary camera sensor is an IMX 890.|1
51_24.wav|It's the same camera sensor that's in the OnePlus 11 and the Nothing Phone 2 and some other phones in the six, $700 range.|1
51_25.wav|And it produces pictures that look kind of like those phones too.|1
51_26.wav|They're decent sometimes in good light, but often a little too much motion blur and a lot too much HDR.|1
51_27.wav|Seriously, sometimes with people as the subjects, it looks like they're just trying to blast the exposure on faces and drag everything else down.|1
51_28.wav|Very aggressive processing, like it's running algorithms made for a sensor from five years ago.|1
51_29.wav|Now, there are upsides, like the super steady video it's now capable of, thanks to the hybrid six axis gimbal, just like the Zenfone.|1
51_30.wav|It means you can shoot slightly better handheld in low light, but it's really smooth video.|1
51_31.wav|And the front facing camera is wider angle, so you can fit more people in the frame, even if it is still kind of HDR-y.|1
51_32.wav|And the telephoto, that's something new that the Zenfone also doesn't have.|1
51_34.wav|If you shoot a lot of zoom, you know, 3X isn't the most zoom in the world, but the stabilization on it is so rock solid.|1
51_36.wav|All that is to say it's leveled up, but it's clearly still not the focus of this phone.|1
51_37.wav|Focus, but it's not the strength of this phone, which might just be fine in another six, $700 phone.|1
108_1.wav|And that's this phone right here.|1
108_3.wav|There's basically three things that make this a crypto phone instead of just another regular Android phone.|1
108_4.wav|It's the Solana Mobile Stack, the Seed Vault, and the dApp Store.|1
108_5.wav|So, okay, outside of those things, this OV1, or the Solana phone, is actually a very average Android phone.|1
108_6.wav|Like specs wise, it's a Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1, so that would be last year's flagship chip, but then 12 gigs of RAM and half a terabyte of storage, although it's unclear if it's fast UFS 3.1.|1
108_7.wav|But it's a nice big 6.67 inch flat 1080p 120 Hertz display at the front that gets decently bright, but it is not LTPO, it's just a fixed refresh rate.|1
108_8.wav|And then it's powered by a 4,100 milliamp hour battery with wireless charging.|1
108_9.wav|Not great for the size of this screen, but not tiny.|1
108_10.wav|And then it's IP68 water and dust resistant with a micro SD card slot for storage expansion.|1
108_11.wav|But then a pair of really mediocre cameras on the back.|1
108_12.wav|It's got the same 50 megapixel main camera sensor that's in the ROG Phone 7 and the Oppo Find X5 Pro, but with worse software.|1
108_14.wav|Just a really very heavily mixed bag here.|1
108_15.wav|But there are two things about this phone that actually I'm very impressed by, that I really like, okay?|1
108_17.wav|is the materials again, just this world-class build quality.|1
108_18.wav|Because like I said, it's basically the same team, the awesome OV1 team that came from the original Essential Phone.|1
108_19.wav|And so they have this affinity for super high quality materials.|1
108_20.wav|So we're talking matte stainless steel frame with colored titanium buttons and a full ceramic back, which yes, picks up fingerprints everywhere other than the fingerprint reader, but|1
108_23.wav|It weighs like 250 grams, which is more than an iPhone 14 Pro Max.|1
108_24.wav|It's got these nice squared off sides that I really like.|1
108_25.wav|There's absolutely no squeaking, creaking, flexing at all.|1
108_26.wav|It's just this hilariously well-made packaging of these average specs.|1
108_27.wav|But then two, the other thing I really like, aside from the crypto stuff, the software itself, once you get into it, is actually extremely clean.|1
108_29.wav|So it is Android 13, and who knows when it'll get Android 14, if at all, but you can dig through everything and it is very quick and responsive and clean everywhere.|1
108_30.wav|It's the stock Android quick settings, the stock Android wallpaper and customization screens, all these stock Google apps, the clock, the calendar, Chrome, everything.|1
108_31.wav|Now, does any of this justify a thousand dollar price tag?|1
108_33.wav|It's got last year's flagship spec,|1
36_0.wav|lets you see through a little bit to the color behind it.|1
36_1.wav|And it even sometimes casts a shadow on the ground in the correct Z space.|1
36_2.wav|So it really solidifies that it's floating in front of you.|1
36_3.wav|All this makes it feel like the window is in the space around you.|1
36_4.wav|Then if you look at the bottom of the window, you get a little bar.|1
36_5.wav|You can always just look at that bar and pinch to drag it around.|1
36_6.wav|So drag it forward, backward, anywhere you want in X, Y, and Z space, and then let go.|1
36_8.wav|And then you can look at either bottom corner to resize, to make it bigger or smaller.|1
36_9.wav|And then finally, there's a little X at the bottom.|1
36_11.wav|So that is the basics of Vision OS and just using an app.|1
36_12.wav|Now, this entire time, by default, and almost any time they can, Passthrough is on.|1
36_13.wav|which means you have the headset on, but you can see with the cameras right through to everything around you.|1
36_14.wav|And I think this is where Apple really wants to normalize the term spatial computing because it feels like augmented reality.|1
36_16.wav|but maybe it's all just semantics.|1
36_17.wav|I will say this is the best pass-through of any VR headset I have ever used, and it's not even that close.|1
36_18.wav|Now, again, it's so hard to get this through a YouTube video.|1
36_19.wav|It does have screen recording built in, so I'm gonna try to use that, but imagine putting a headset on,|1
36_21.wav|Also the pass-through is so close to real time that I could legitimately interact with all kinds of things.|1
36_22.wav|I could catch items flying at me.|1
36_25.wav|So officially the R1 chip is doing all the processing of all this stuff and adjusting the shutter speed for different lighting conditions and always keeping pass-through latency under 12 milliseconds, which is the lowest in the industry.|1
36_26.wav|But it's really combining that with how close to reality the colors and brightness and everything are that keeps it feeling kind of real.|1
36_27.wav|Basically, the only noticeable restriction is super close up items and objects can get a bit blurry.|1
36_28.wav|And then you can't quite make out like really small or fine texts.|1
36_29.wav|So you can't like read an email or tiny text on your phone in your hand, but you can absolutely text people or read your notifications while keeping the headset on.|1
36_30.wav|If you've tried other VR headsets, you know how impressive that is.|1
36_31.wav|It's just, it's really good with the tech that exists now for VR headsets.|1
36_32.wav|But you can definitely still take the headset off and be like, oh, it's way brighter in here than I thought it was.|1
36_33.wav|Either way, that's all passed through.|1
36_34.wav|But if you ever want to fully immerse yourself, I mean, it is a VR headset after all.|1
48_1.wav|It's still on the phones, it still works, but we'll have to see.|1
48_3.wav|I got to test how good these screens are, how well these new cameras work and all that stuff.|1
48_4.wav|And maybe there's some other stuff buried in that I haven't found yet that isn't just|1
116_1.wav|So if we tally these all up here, you can see that the objective winner in four out of the seven categories that I made up is the iPhone.|1
116_2.wav|But, but, put your pitchforks down, guess what?|1
116_3.wav|There is no, as you've probably picked up from the beginning of this video, there is no objective winner to a decision as personal as this one and when the options are this close.|1
116_4.wav|You probably already know, if you've been watching my videos, you know I main an Android phone most of the time alongside an iPhone, but my main phone and my main customized setups are on the Android phone.|1
116_6.wav|Like picking one de facto winner kind of suggests that the one winner is best for everyone.|1
116_7.wav|But we already know that people, there's some people who literally don't care about some features that some others would say they can't live without.|1
116_8.wav|So I've devised a very basic system to help you pick your winner for yourself.|1
116_10.wav|All you have to do is put these seven categories in order of importance to you.|1
116_11.wav|and then rate each one of them, let's say on a scale from one to five.|1
116_12.wav|So give them a one to five point rating based on how much you care about it.|1
116_13.wav|So here for me, I care the most about customization and features.|1
116_14.wav|Then I care a lot about apps and excitement and updates are decently important, but then in my daily driver, ease of use and ecosystem aren't that big of a deal.|1
116_16.wav|So then I just give the amount of points earned to each winner of that category.|1
116_17.wav|So the winner for me is clearly Android.|1
116_18.wav|But hey, for you, maybe you care a lot about ecosystem and maybe nothing else.|1
116_20.wav|Then the iPhone will clearly be calling your name.|1
99_0.wav|But most importantly, the new cable in the iPhone box for all new iPhones is a single white braided USB-C to USB-C cable.|1
99_1.wav|I think this is the first time the iPhone is shipping with a braided nice cable like this.|1
99_2.wav|So hopefully it'll be a higher quality and more durable than old cables we've been getting for years.|1
99_3.wav|So cool, USB-C cable, USB-C phone.|1
99_4.wav|Now, if we take a look at the Plus, same idea, bigger box, but this new incredibly pale yellow.|1
99_5.wav|I mean, again, in perfect lighting at the Apple event, I think it looked a little bit more colorful, but it just looks extremely pale out here.|1
99_6.wav|And then we've got the Pro boxes for the Pro phones as well.|1
99_7.wav|Still white boxes, but dark wallpapers.|1
99_8.wav|So the iPhone 15 Pro I have here is the new dark blue color.|1
99_9.wav|I almost want to call this one barely blue again, but this time it's darker and kind of borders on gray when the light hits it from certain angles.|1
99_12.wav|The paperwork, the white Apple sticker, and the new braided USB-C cable.|1
99_13.wav|And then our iPhone 15 Pro Max here is the new natural titanium color.|1
99_14.wav|And I gotta say guys, I think this is gonna be the one to get.|1
99_15.wav|It's the best color in person in the hand.|1
99_16.wav|I'll talk more about why in a minute, but there you have it.|1
99_17.wav|The slightly new unboxing experience on iPhone 15s and 15 Pros.|1
99_18.wav|So by the time you see this, I've been testing these phones for about six days now.|1
99_19.wav|Not quite enough time for a review by my standards, but still plenty of time to give you some interesting thoughts, some things that I've picked up on, and some quirks.|1
99_20.wav|So first of all, these pale colors, I don't really know how else to say it.|1
99_22.wav|I always get told everyone's gonna put a case on their phone, which they probably are.|1
99_23.wav|But hey, Apple did spend a ton of time and money making this new, softer touch, satin finish on the back.|1
99_24.wav|And some of us, some of us, will carry our phones around with no case.|1
99_26.wav|For the pro phones, there's actually an extra layer of interesting though, because they've switched that rail material, the part that you actually touch on the outside, from shiny stainless steel to brushed titanium.|1
99_27.wav|We've all heard about how much lighter it is, and it's something like 10% lighter, which is enough for me to notice and enjoy.|1
99_28.wav|But the other thing is, I thought the brushed finish would sort of eliminate fingerprints on the sides.|1
99_31.wav|I mean, it's less, it's not as bad as stainless steel, but especially on these darker colors, like the black or this blue, you can totally see fingerprints and sort of where your hand oils are marking up the sides of the phone.|1
99_32.wav|And then on top of that, this is not anodized like aluminum might be.|1
99_33.wav|This is the new PVD coating they talked about on stage.|1
99_35.wav|And so I don't know exactly how well this will hold up over time.|1
99_36.wav|But what I do know is if you get a scratch deep enough into this coating,|1
99_37.wav|It's got to be the natural titanium color underneath, which is very light.|1
99_38.wav|And so that might look rough if you, if you drop this phone with no case and get like a big gash on your dark colored phone and have light marks all over it.|1
99_39.wav|All of that to say, I do really think that this natural titanium or the light is going to be the better color to get on the pros this year.|1
7_1.wav|So if you don't like the back of this phone, at least the front of it that you're looking at all the time.|1
7_3.wav|But I'd say an even bigger strength of this phone is battery life.|1
7_4.wav|So battery always comes from like three main things basically, obviously having a huge physical battery, also good software and an efficient chip.|1
7_5.wav|We'll get to the software, but this phone has a 5,000 milliamp hour battery.|1
7_6.wav|That's literally bigger than their flagship phones from nothing.|1
7_8.wav|It doesn't have wireless charging, but it does have 45 watt wired charging, which is pretty good.|1
7_10.wav|And the chip it's running is this little thing called the MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro.|1
7_11.wav|So this was my biggest question mark actually going into testing this phone, because you know how nothing teases the specs and stuff ahead of time.|1
7_12.wav|So we find out it's a MediaTek chip, and I'm not sure if this one's going to perform the way I've been used to some other phones.|1
7_13.wav|Like they're showcasing all these, you know, specifically hand-picked benchmarks results.|1
7_15.wav|but conveniently they only compare it to a 2-year-old Nothing Phone 1 which had that mid-range 778G Plus from Qualcomm.|1
7_16.wav|Now, I'm not expecting flagship stuff for $350, but like, what's it gonna land at?|1
7_17.wav|This feels like a make-or-break part of the phone.|1
7_20.wav|It's not going to win any prizes with raw specs, and I definitely don't think it'll earn anybody's money with the benchmark scores alone, but as far as actual performance, when you use the phone,|1
7_22.wav|And I really feel like that is a testament to the software and how well it's working together.|1
7_23.wav|So at this point, we're on nothing OS 2.5 on top of Android 14.|1
7_24.wav|And you already have seen nothing phone software with the dots and the aesthetic and all that stuff, but.|1
7_25.wav|It's clean, there's no bloatware, and there is a solid focus on fast and smooth.|1
7_26.wav|It kind of feels like a throwback to the old OnePlus Magic back in the day.|1
7_27.wav|But with regular use, this phone is quite smooth and snappy.|1
7_28.wav|Sometimes the fingerprint reader shudders a little bit, like when you're first unlocking, but for the most part, if you're just using the phone, doing stuff like messaging or flipping through a couple apps, email, web browsing, taking your pictures,|1
7_30.wav|It's pretty similar to what they did with the Nothing Phone 1 with the 778.|1
7_31.wav|It's very solid with everyday use, and the second you try to do super high-end stuff, like gaming, then you'll see where the benchmarks come up short, where you start dropping frames and all that.|1
7_32.wav|But, again, this is a $350 phone, and I am definitely not complaining about that.|1
7_33.wav|Now, Nothing has had some time now to build up their aesthetic and their identity and what they really want|1
71_0.wav|MacBook with a new chip, and I thought that that new color on top of that new chip would be enough for me to go, all right, you know what?|1
71_4.wav|I clicked the order button and I purchased a new maxed out M3 Max MacBook Pro in matte black.|1
71_5.wav|But now that I've actually had this review unit here and I've gone through my testing and I've experienced it, the color is kind of nice, but it's not quite as impressive and new as I was maybe hoping.|1
71_8.wav|I logged in and I canceled my order and I will continue to daily what I have for the past, I guess, three years now with the M1 Max 16-inch MacBook Pro.|1
71_11.wav|If you have M2 Max or M1 Max,|1
71_12.wav|M3 Max is not really for you.|1
71_13.wav|This is like any other spec bump far more for people with older machines.|1
114_1.wav|And at this point, they are both flourishing.|1
114_5.wav|Basically every major app is available for both platforms, which means there are many more, you know, niche apps or relatively unknown possible diamonds in the rough on the Google Play Store, sure.|1
114_9.wav|If you just have to update one version of your app,|1
114_10.wav|and it works with all the newest iPhones instantly and works perfectly for millions of people who all have basically the same aspect ratio, of course you'd do it.|1
114_12.wav|But with Android, there are naturally many more complexities.|1
114_13.wav|There are a bunch of different devices that all have different aspect ratios and different pixel densities and different feature support and even foldables.|1
114_14.wav|And it's like, it's a lot more work to get all of those users up to date with the same level of optimization.|1
114_16.wav|So a lot of them just don't go through all of that, or they take way longer to.|1
114_17.wav|So the number of titles is one thing, but is it the same Instagram app on both iPhone and Android?|1
114_18.wav|Is it the same threads app on each one?|1
114_20.wav|They come first to the iPhone before they come to Android.|1
114_22.wav|I wish they were just as easy to do one or the other, but that's just the truth of it.|1
114_23.wav|So the slight app advantage is gonna go to the iPhone here.|1
114_24.wav|And interestingly enough, this also applies generally to accessories.|1
114_25.wav|Again, same reason, same efficiency, but that's a win for the iPhone.|1
114_26.wav|So then category number six, I'm gonna go a little more subjective with this one, but I still think it matters.|1
114_28.wav|Which one is more interesting or exciting in the moment to you?|1
114_29.wav|Now, honestly, I get pretty excited for a lot of different new tech these days.|1
114_30.wav|And actually, because there's only like one or two new iPhone drops every year, it's actually very easy to get hype built up for the new iPhone.|1
114_31.wav|But it's definitely a different type of excitement with the massive variety of new innovations and things that come to Android phones.|1
114_33.wav|Like if you just are interested in folding phones, well there's more Android releases than ever for that.|1
114_38.wav|Do you want the world's fastest charging?|1
114_39.wav|Do you want some interesting new unique designs or materials or textures or experimental features?|1
114_41.wav|And if you think about it, seriously think about this, most of the interesting excitement around every new iPhone|1
0_0.wav|over time, so I'll leave a link to this one below.|1
0_1.wav|But the other new thing is this M3 chip inside.|1
0_2.wav|So we've seen this M3 chip before, this is what Apple does, they put the same chip everywhere.|1
0_3.wav|This came out in October of last year and they immediately put it in the new iMac.|1
0_4.wav|And then we also got a new MacBook Pro that launched with this and the M3 Pro and the M3 Max.|1
0_5.wav|So, okay, new M3, Apple Silicon third generation, great.|1
0_6.wav|So now we're finally getting this new base M3 chip in the new MacBook Air.|1
0_10.wav|It feels like Apple kind of staggers it probably on purpose, but like it's the same chip everywhere.|1
0_11.wav|They've done the iMac, they've done the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, but the Mac mini just staying on M2, kind of weird.|1
0_12.wav|Also the new iPad Pro still on M2.|1
0_14.wav|Anyway, you already know that the MacBook Air is the most popular Mac for a reason.|1
0_15.wav|This is the base entry level Mac that most people are seeing as the way to get into the Mac world.|1
0_16.wav|And so the base MacBook Air has typically been one of the easiest to recommend laptops in the world by design.|1
0_17.wav|But this one, interestingly, for two reasons,|1
0_19.wav|Now, this has nothing to do with performance of M3 or anything weird like that.|1
0_20.wav|Like, it's the performance you were expecting.|1
0_21.wav|If you look at benchmarks, it's right around that 10 to 20% improvement over M2, depending on what you're doing.|1
0_22.wav|Definitely leans heavier on graphics improvements this generation.|1
0_24.wav|So any applications or rendering that are taking advantage of that, that's going to be a noticeable improvement for M3.|1
0_26.wav|And also MacBook Airs, especially the 15 inch, just constantly get great battery life across the board.|1
0_27.wav|You also get now dual external display support with the lid closed, but one external display with the laptop open.|1
0_28.wav|And it also appears that the base storage on M3 is much improved.|1
0_29.wav|So this was one of those concerns from, if you look back at M2.|1
0_30.wav|You know, obviously Apple seeds reviewers with higher end MacBooks, so most of us aren't getting that.|1
0_31.wav|But if you look back at M2, the base 256 gig model used a single SSD module instead of two SSDs.|1
0_32.wav|Long story short, that storage module was way slower than M1, like 50% slower on paper.|1
0_33.wav|Would you have noticed if nobody told you and had never benchmarked it?|1
0_34.wav|Maybe, possibly not, but obviously it's a bummer having way slower storage on a new M2 and that extra time transferring large files, that adds up over time.|1
0_35.wav|So I'm happy to report that I've seen really good benchmarks on the base storage of the M3 Air.|1
0_39.wav|Why am I saying it's not necessarily the best recommendation?|1
0_40.wav|Well, historically, MacBook Air has been super easy to recommend, but with this M3, they also lowered the price of M2 by a hundred bucks and discontinued the M1.|1
0_41.wav|So now the lineup is M3 MacBook Air starts at $1099.|1
0_42.wav|Then M2 MacBook Air starts at $999 and then M1, it's|1
1_0.wav|kind of gone from Apple, but you can still find stock that's left at like Walmart or Best Buy.|1
1_2.wav|So these people, the type of people who would buy a laptop at Walmart,|1
1_3.wav|would be totally fine with the cheaper, identical looking MacBook Air.|1
1_4.wav|With the slightly slower M.2 chip and slower storage, I think they would be totally fine.|1
1_5.wav|But the other thing which I need to talk about is this whole base spec thing.|1
1_6.wav|This is not exactly new to the industry, but the base price and the base spec has almost become like this weird fallacy.|1
1_7.wav|Like I think it was Linus who did a video about how starting at it's like the biggest lie in tech.|1
1_10.wav|Like the car industry does it all the time too.|1
1_11.wav|starting at, you know, this super low price, but nobody actually gets it at that price.|1
1_12.wav|You're not going to get a totally bare base model car.|1
1_13.wav|The base price is really more to give you an idea of how much you're about to spend when you actually option it up the way you want to.|1
1_14.wav|And the issue with these is Apple's markup prices for above base spec is|1
1_15.wav|crazy high, like Apple charges way too much for the most basic upgrades.|1
1_16.wav|Obviously, Apple Silicon computers are all a system on a chip, so they cannot be upgraded ever after you buy them, right?|1
1_17.wav|So once you buy it, you're kind of incentivized if you're gonna keep it for a long time to splurge a little bit and give yourself some extra headroom and future-proof it and bump up that spec.|1
1_18.wav|But Apple charges so much for bumping up that spec that the base price feels like kind of even more of a lie than usual.|1
1_20.wav|starts in 2024 again at 8 gigs of shared RAM and 256 gigs of storage.|1
1_21.wav|Now, ignoring the fact that the phone I'm using also has more than 8 gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of storage, if you want to upgrade to 16 gigs of memory, the first available RAM upgrade, that's $200.|1
1_22.wav|And if you want to bump up to just a half a terabyte of storage, that's another|1
1_23.wav|200 more dollars compared to how much that actually costs Apple, especially at the scale that they're operating.|1
1_24.wav|That is just crazy, brutal, ridiculous pricing.|1
1_25.wav|So even if you do just that, suddenly the MacBook Air M3 is $1,500.|1
1_26.wav|So either you're cool with knowing you're actually buying a 1500 plus dollar MacBook Air, or the real question is, is the base spec in 2024 actually usable?|1
1_28.wav|Actually, sometimes yes, sometimes yes.|1
1_29.wav|So again, if you're the people I talked about earlier, you're buying a laptop from the showcase at Walmart or Best Buy, you just needed to do the basic stuff I mentioned earlier.|1
1_30.wav|You actually can do that with eight gigs of shared memory.|1
90_0.wav|shoot video directly onto an external drive.|1
90_1.wav|Now there's some talk about the cable that comes in the box.|1
90_2.wav|Remember that nice high quality braided USB-C cable that comes in the box?|1
90_3.wav|But it's only USB 2.0 transfer speeds.|1
90_5.wav|So if you have a pro phone, you need to get a faster separate cable for it.|1
90_8.wav|Most smartphones come with just a USB-C cable just to charge.|1
90_10.wav|If you wanted a data cable, you'd have to buy a thicker, more robust cable that looks the same, but is a data cable.|1
90_11.wav|It's kind of confusing and annoying, actually.|1
90_12.wav|Welcome to the world of USB-C, my friends.|1
90_14.wav|But that is a good segue to the main enabler, the new powerhouse chip inside this phone with a new name, the A17 Pro.|1
90_15.wav|So the base iPhone 15s got last year's A16 Bionic from the 14 Pro.|1
90_16.wav|And so here's this new, more powerful chip in the highest end phones.|1
90_17.wav|And it's not the A17 Bionic, this is the first one with the Pro name, A17 Pro.|1
90_18.wav|And this thing goes kind of crazy on paper.|1
90_19.wav|This is their first three nanometer chip.|1
90_20.wav|Actually the first three nanometer chip in any phone that we'll probably see for at least another year or two.|1
90_22.wav|It's literally approaching M1 chip levels of synthetic benchmark scores.|1
90_23.wav|And compared to last year, it's 10 to 20% more powerful on both the CPU and the GPU, which is very respectable.|1
90_24.wav|But more power is like more horsepower in a car.|1
90_25.wav|It's only really useful or noticeable if it lets you do more things with it.|1
90_26.wav|I'm gonna live in this analogy a bit more for a minute.|1
90_29.wav|Like the pro iPhone's been great at just surfing Instagram and texting and doing all the normal web browsing, basic stuff you'd do on a phone.|1
90_30.wav|And so the only place you'd really notice the extra performance is, well, we got a gaming demo.|1
90_31.wav|Apple showed these wild demos on the new iPhone at the keynote.|1
90_32.wav|And just a disclaimer, I'm not much of a phone gamer, so I'll defer the commentary on this to Dave2D.|1
90_34.wav|but they literally launched exclusive games on the iPhone that are like Resident Evil Village and Assassin's Creed, but not on cut down mobile versions.|1
90_35.wav|These are literally the same versions with the same assets and same textures and everything from the PlayStation version.|1
90_36.wav|because it literally is the PlayStation version.|1
90_38.wav|Plus, you know, performance headroom is never a bad thing.|1
90_39.wav|But I think also for me and for a lot of other people, the more impactful things that you'll actually notice about this new chip are in the dedicated parts of it that are for specific tasks.|1
90_40.wav|Like the new image signal processor lets you take really, really fast lag-free photos constantly.|1
90_41.wav|The new neural engine recognizes portrait mode subjects like people's faces|1
85_0.wav|So how do we square those two things?|1
85_1.wav|Like you would think that relying on a big company is better than relying on a small one, as far as like supporting projects down the road.|1
85_2.wav|Like if I was gonna set up a new smart home, for example, I wouldn't wanna set up one with like a tiny startup that I don't know if they're gonna exist in five years, because then all my smart home stuff might not work when that company goes out of business.|1
85_3.wav|So you'd think a bigger, more established company would be more reliable, but it turns out the same problem can happen when you rely on|1
85_4.wav|a gigantic company like Google because something you might get invested in or start using might just be like a small rounding error for them that they might just get rid of at any time.|1
85_5.wav|So I think the thing that really summarizes this all well is I have a friend that says that Google is super willing to spin up new projects and be aggressive and innovative all the time.|1
85_6.wav|But if that new project doesn't either get a billion users or make a billion dollars, then it is liable to get axed at any time.|1
85_7.wav|So that's why, literally, just in the past few weeks, we have seen Google Domains, Google Jamboard, Google Podcasts, and Pixel Pass all killed.|1
85_8.wav|all active services with various amounts of users just destroyed, just killed.|1
85_9.wav|And the further back you go, the more there are.|1
85_10.wav|It feels like a running joke that Google will announce and kill a new messaging service every year, but just keep strolling back.|1
85_11.wav|There's entire webpages dedicated to chronicling the long list of things that Google has killed.|1
85_12.wav|Remember Google+, remember the Inbox app, remember Hangouts, remember Allo, remember Chromecast Audio, Stadia,|1
85_14.wav|Now when they kill these products or services, there are often various degrees to which they're able to replace them or support everyone that they just rug pulled.|1
85_15.wav|So like something like Google Play Music, okay, they were launching another service called YouTube Music and it had a lot of congruent features so they didn't have|1
85_16.wav|the need to have both so they made it easy to port your entire library from one to the other.|1
85_17.wav|You'd still be missing some features but at least you still have your whole library so that was nice.|1
85_19.wav|Good effort, it's good to at least try to do that sort of thing, but it's not always perfect.|1
85_21.wav|And it's gone now, or at least by the end of the year it'll be gone, so I guess...|1
85_22.wav|We'll just find something else to use.|1
85_23.wav|Google Stadia, the gaming service, only lasted a couple of years.|1
85_24.wav|The only saving grace with this one is when it got axed, they would at least let you export your saved data so you could use it on another platform.|1
85_25.wav|And then they refunded every Stadia user for every game.|1
85_26.wav|But again, there are no alternatives.|1
85_27.wav|Fun fact, and this is a true story, I had literally just switched mkbhd.com from Squarespace to Google Domains.|1
85_28.wav|It was like a big domain transfer process that took like 24 hours and I was like nervous to do it, but I finally did it.|1
28_0.wav|And you also get a free upgrade to the 16 gigs of RAM half terabyte model for that price if you pre-order.|1
28_1.wav|It's literally already marked down to that on Amazon, so I'll have a link below.|1
28_2.wav|Flagship price, yes.|1
28_3.wav|But when it's competing theoretically against some of the ultra phones, $1,000, $1,200, $1,300, then suddenly it's kind of in the category of, dare I say,|1
28_5.wav|So look, it's nearly the same on the outside.|1
28_6.wav|They've found what they like, and they're keeping it consistent, same shapes, same camera bump circle that kind of melts into the side with these neural details around it.|1
28_7.wav|It's still Gorilla Glass 5 on the back, and there's a new set of colors and textures, but in general, you'd be forgiven for thinking it's nearly the same as last year.|1
28_8.wav|Or maybe you wouldn't, but don't let that fool you.|1
28_9.wav|Up front, this screen is, I think, the biggest noticeable physical difference from last year.|1
28_10.wav|It gets way brighter, up to 1600 nits outdoors, and it's hitting crazy numbers now.|1
28_12.wav|Basically, it's super impressive and extremely readable outdoors and in any light, but it also gets|1
28_14.wav|Now I don't like that it's this curved over the edges.|1
28_15.wav|Like you can see the light fall off and the extra reflections that come with that.|1
28_16.wav|But basically from corner to corner, this 6.8 inch 1440P LTPO Pro XDR display is a real upgrade over last year.|1
28_17.wav|So then the rest of the upgrades to this phone are definitely a case of a bunch of little changes all like stacking up on top of each other to equal a large difference from last year.|1
28_19.wav|Like that's what smartphones are nowadays.|1
28_20.wav|I remember reviewing the OnePlus One and then the OnePlus Two the next year, and just the gigantic total shift, big direction changes between those two phones.|1
28_21.wav|Nowadays, it's just about like finding a bunch of clever little things and stacking a bunch of little improvements on top of each other to just make the user experience a little better.|1
28_22.wav|So obviously, if you're gonna be a flagship killer, you gotta have the newest chip inside.|1
28_23.wav|So it does, it's the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.|1
28_24.wav|Not that you'll notice a whole ton of difference side by side with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 phone,|1
28_25.wav|but this phone does have much better cooling as well.|1
28_26.wav|So it's giving them some headroom to play with slightly boosted clock speeds and it's benchmarking right behind the gaming phones and the S24 Ultra.|1
28_27.wav|In real world use, that just means this phone is super fast.|1
28_30.wav|Like this is something OnePlus has done really well for a long time, even with high performance mode being off in the battery settings by default.|1
28_31.wav|But speaking of battery, this phone is definitely prioritizing battery, super long battery life over like ultra high end performance numbers and getting every last FPS out of the thing.|1
28_32.wav|And as a result, this is a battery champ.|1
28_34.wav|So it's got one of the biggest batteries ever in a OnePlus flagship.|1
28_35.wav|It's now a 5,400 milliamp hour battery.|1
28_36.wav|That's bigger than a lot of other phones that are ultras now.|1
28_37.wav|And you better believe they've kept their trademark super fast charging also.|1
